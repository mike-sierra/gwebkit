<p>This guide helps developers target web content and applications to WebKit-based browsing environments. It introduces HTML5 as an all-purpose web application framework, and shows how developers can deploy applications across a wide range of target browsing environments, spanning desktop browsers, mobile browsers, mobile web-based applications, and web-based components within natively compiled mobile applications.</p>
<p>For those interested in deploying web content to mobile browsers, or extending existing mobile web content to WebKit-based mobile browsers, it provides basic guidelines to support a wide range of mobile browsers. Using a hands-on approach, numerous sample pages demonstrate exactly how browser capabilities translate to engaging real-world mobile interfaces.</p>
<a name="who-should-read-this"></a>
<h3>Who Should Read This?</h3>
<p>This guide assumes that you are familiar with basic web technologies such HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It explains the various ways that these technologies can be enhanced with recent HTML5 and CSS3 features to deploy vibrant applications, both for web browsers and when embedded into native applications. While it describes the specific capabilities of WebKit, it discusses how to target applications across the widest possible range of browsers.</p>
<p>This guide will also help if you are relatively unfamiliar with the specific requirements and design constraints of mobile web development. It discusses strategies to deploy mobile websites or hybrid mobile/desktop sites. Alternately, if you are more familiar with lower-level mobile browser capabilities prior to the widespread adoption of more powerful touch-screen handsets, this guide will update you on the latest features. This guide will also be useful if you are evaluating Web-based applications as an all-purpose development platform spanning the widest range of devices and operating systems.</p>

<h3>Introducing HTML5</h3>
<p>The term <i>HTML5</i> refers to draft specifications by the World Wide Web Consortium detailing the more recent state of web-based standards. In practice and throughout this guide, the term is used more loosely to refer to this specification's latest set of features, to the related specification for Level 3 CSS, and to additional new WebKit features that fall outside these specifications. Major new HTML5 features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Geolocation</b>: Knowing where mobile users are helps to target relevant contextual information. (See the <a href="location.html">Location and Travel</a> section for more information.)</li>
<li><b>Multimedia</b>: Open standards-based audio and video allows wider interoperability and less reliance on proprietary formats. (See <a href="av.html">Multimedia</a>.)</li>
<li><b>Application caching and offline mode</b>: These standards allow application functionality to reside entirely on the client handset and to respond to changes in network availability. (See <a href="webapp.html">Web Apps</a> and <a href="offline.html">Offline Mode</a>.)</li>
<li><b>Client-side data storage</b>: Simplifies session management and private data, while encouraging loosely coupled synchronization. (See <a href="storage.html">Data Storage</a>.)</li>
<li><b>CSS3</b>: Updated CSS properties provide designers with a richer palette of visual effects. (See <sub>CSS3</sub>.)</li>
<li><b>CSS Animations</b>: Fosters more engaging, dynamic interfaces. (See <a href="animation.html">Animations</a>.)</li>
<li><b>Form validation</b>: Simplifies form input, and lessens the need for server-side validation. (See <a href="input.html">Input Types</a> and <a href="form.html">Input Validation</a>.)</li>
<li><b>Canvas, SVG</b>: Powerful graphics/animation frameworks. (See <a href="canvas.html">Canvas</a>.)</li>
<li><b>Media queries</b>: Extends existing CSS <i>media types</i> to target content to specific classes of browser. (See <a href="query.html">Responsive Interfaces</a>.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Introducing the Mobile Web</h3>
<p>Modern Web-based technologies offer a powerful standards-based development platform with which to deploy applications across a wide range of mobile handsets. To get to this level, the Mobile Web has passed through several generations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first generation relied upon WAP and WML. These represented a separate set of mobile-only standards targeted for handsets that were insufficiently powerful to render standard web content.</li>
<li>The second generation relied upon basic web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but were often deployed in a nonstandard way by individual browser vendors. Early mobile &quot;web&quot; sites were slow and buggy, featuring at best only core web features.</li>
<li>Third-generation mobile web browsers embed desktop-class web engines, such as WebKit, Gecko, Presto, and Trident onto mobile handsets. Reliance on these standard software components led to greater stability and less variation among browsers.<p>These web engines are also used to power widget and web runtime platforms that allow developers to package and install Web applications onto mobile devices. They also enable WebView APIs that allow web content to appear within and interact with native applications.</p>
</li>
<li>The latest generation of the Mobile Web features emerging HTML5 and CSS3 web standards that bring powerful rendering, storage, location, and multimedia features to mobile handsets. HTML5 is increasingly regarded as a common platform that serves as an attractive alternative to device-specific development.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latest generation mobile web runs on touch-based handsets featuring fast processors and ample storage. They are backed by high-bandwidth networks whose speeds support distributed network-based Ajax applications and rich multimedia content. Their larger screens present users with a wider range of options and more engaging responsiveness, and allow developers to use the same sort of rich graphic interfaces they deploy for desktop browsers.</p>

<h3>About the Samples</h3>
<p>This guide supplies numerous sample web pages that demonstrate specific features available to web developers and designers. In most cases, they can be previewed on WebKit-based browsers such as Apple Safari and Google Chrome. In a few cases, functionality such as multi-point touch may not be able to display within desktop browsers.</p>
<p>These samples are designed to be as clear as possible, with simplified functionality intended for adaptation within more comprehensive mobile applications. In the interest of clarity, these samples do not rely on JavaScript libraries such as jQuery and Prototype.</p>
