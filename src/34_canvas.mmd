# Canvas

The Browser supports HTML5 _canvas_ graphics. The `canvas`
element provides a transparent painting surface on which newly placed
graphic elements overwrite existing pixel data.  To start drawing,
specify the canvas's `width` and `height` to set the pixel
dimensions of the painting surface:

```
<canvas id="graphic" width="320" height="370">
    <!-- fallback content -->
    Sorry, your browser does not support HTML5 Canvas.
</canvas>
```

The canvas's dimensions can be modified superficially via CSS, but
changing the actual number of pixels clears any current image data.
Here are two ways to shrink a canvas to half its size, the latter of
which clears any displaying pixels:

```
var cv = document.querySelector('canvas');

// displays pixels:
cv.style.width = Math.floor(cv.width / 2) + 'px';
cv.style.height = Math.floor(cv.width / 2) + 'px';

// clears pixels:
cv.width = Math.floor(cv.width / 2);
cv.height = Math.floor(cv.height / 2);
```

Use the canvas's two-dimensional _context_ to access the API that
modifies its contents:

```
var cv = document.querySelector('canvas');
var cx = cv.getContext('2d');
// canvas also available as cx.canvas
```

> __NOTE__: Mobile browsers do not yet support the three-dimensional WebGL
canvas context.

This section offers a brief tour of canvas's core graphics effects.

##  Paths

This simple example shows a series of graphic commands that draws the
accompanying arrow:

\table

\row

\li

\image canvasArrow.png

\li

```
cx.fillStyle = 'red';
cx.strokeStyle = 'rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 0.5)'; // semi-transparent
cx.lineWidth = 10;

cx.beginPath();
cx.moveTo(70,15);
cx.lineTo(10,115);
cx.lineTo(40,115);
cx.lineTo(40,225);
cx.lineTo(100,225);
cx.lineTo(100,115);
cx.lineTo(130,115);
cx.lineTo(70,15);
cx.closePath();

cx.fill();
cx.stroke();
```

\endtable

After an initial `beginPath()` declaration, the `moveTo()`
coordinate sets an origin point for the shape. The path is defined by
a series of `lineTo()` coordinates, ended by `closePath()`.  The
shape only renders when either `fill()` or `stroke()` are called.
Global properties such as `fillStyle`, `strokeStyle`, and
`lineWidth` configure their appearance.

Since canvases are based on pixels rather than vector objects, most
shapes you add cannot respond independently to touch input. However,
the `isPointInPath()` method allows you to test whether a coordinate
falls within the most recently declared path. The following touch
handler, attached to the `canvas` element, responds only when the
touch point falls within the arrow:

```
document.querySelector('canvas').addEventListener('touchstart', function(e) {
    if (! event.target.getContext('2d').isPointInPath(
       e.targetTouches[0].offsetX, e.targetTouches[0].offsetY ) )
           return(false);
    // touch falls within arrow
});
```

The `targetTouches` array further helps identify touch points that
fall within the canvas itself. For more information, see
\l{Touch Gestures}.

##  Rectangles

The `rect()` method defines a rectangular path that behaves the same
way as the polygon above. It requires _x_ and `y` offsets,
followed by width and height.  The `fillRect()` and `strokeRect()`
methods provide common shortcuts, while `clearRect()` removes
regions of pixels. (Adding transparent pixels does not change existing
pixels.) This draws various rectangular patterns behind the arrow:

\table

\row

\li

\image canvasArrowRect.png

\li

```
cx.fillStyle = 'lightblue';
// cx.rect(0,0,140,240);
// cx.fill();
cx.fillRect(0,0,140,240);  // same as 2 commented lines above

cx.clearRect(20,20,100,200); // removes pixels

cx.strokeStyle = 'gold';
cx.lineWidth = 6;
// cx.rect(30,30,80,180);
// cx.stroke();
cx.strokeRect(30,30,80,180); // same as 2 commented lines above

// ...draw arrow
```

\endtable

##  Reading and Writing Images

To import an image into a canvas, reference its DOM object. This
places the image at the top left corner:

```
var img = new Image();
img.src = "img/sign.jpg";
cx.drawImage(img,0,0);
```

Alternately, you can import another `canvas` object.  With two
additional measurements, `drawImage()` only renders the image within
a specified width and height. With eight measurements, the first four
specify the offsets and dimensions of the source image, and the next
four specify the same for the destination canvas. This shows a 42
\Etimes 42 selection from the source image that is doubled in size and
placed at the canvas's top left corner:

\table

\row

\li

\image canvasImgSize.png

\li

```
cx.drawImage(img,160,272,42,42,0,0,84,84);
```

\endtable

To save the contents of a canvas as a static image, use the canvas
object's `toDataURL()` method. The canvas object is also available
by calling `context.canvas`:

```
var img = new Image();
img.src = cx.canvas.toDataUrl();
// also toDataUrl('image/png') or toDataUrl('image/jpeg');
// toDataUrl('image/jpeg', 0.5) renders JPEG at "half" quality
```

This produces a `data:` prefixed encoding of the image data that can
be substituted for an external filename. Here's an example of an image
that's been modified to include the arrow:

\image canvasDrawImage.png

##  Clipping Paths

The `clip()` method allows you to limit the scope of graphics
operations to within the currently defined path. For example, after
defining the path for the arrow as shown above, you can fill it with
an image:

\table

\row

\li

\image canvas_clip.png

\li

```
cx.beginPath();
// ...define arrow
cx.endPath();

cx.clip(); // subsequent graphics appear only within path

var img = new Image();
img.src = "img/sign.jpg";
cx.drawImage(img,-110,-200); // offsets to frame selected portion
```

\endtable

##  Arcs and Curves

Arcs offer another way to define a path. The `arc()` method accepts
six arguments: a pair of _x_/_y_ coordinates at the center point,
a radius measurement in pixels, and a pair of start and end angles,
originating from the right edge and measured in radians. A sixth
boolean argument specifies if the arc renders along a counterclockwise
path. The following shows a pair of arcs that specify a 5:00 position
relative to the origin:

\table

\row

\li

\image canvasArc.png

\li

```
cx.beginPath();
cx.arc(50, 50, 40, 0, (Math.PI*5)/6, false);
cx.closePath()
cx.stroke();

cx.beginPath();
cx.arc(150, 50, 40, 0, (Math.PI*5)/6, true);
cx.stroke();
cx.closePath()
```

\endtable

The `arcTo()` method accepts five arguments: a pair of _x_/_y_
coordinates for a control point, another pair for a destination point,
and a radius. It works differently than the `arc()` method, fitting
the arc within the angle that forms between the starting point, the
control point, and the destination point.  This example compares arcs
that are defined by the same set of control and destination points,
but that vary in radius:

\table

\row

\li

```
cx.arcTo(250, 50, 250, 250, 100);
```

\image canvasArcTo1.png

\li

```
cx.arcTo(250, 50, 250, 250, 50);
```

\image canvasArcTo2.png

\endtable

The `arcTo()` method renders any necessary line leading up to the
arc, but not following it. The `quadraticCurveTo()` method also
requires coordinates for control point and destination point, and
renders curves more flexibly:

```
cx.quadraticCurveTo(250, 50, 250, 250);
```

\image canvasQuad.png

The `bezierCurveTo()` method works the same way, but uses an
additional control point to define more complex curves:

```
cx.bezierCurveTo(250, 50, 50, 250, 250, 250);
```

\image canvasBez.png

Use the following interactive utility to see how various curves appear
with different sets of control points, and see how they are reflected
as JavaScript code. This example shows how `arcTo()` behaves when
there's not enough room to place the arc between a set of control
points.

\l{x_canvasCurve_htm} {
  \inlineimage canvasCurve.png
}

##  Transforms and Canvas State

In the examples above, all new graphics are positioned relative to the
canvas's default top-left origin point. _Transforms_ allow you to
shift this origin point, and rotate and scale the painting surface
within the canvas prior to rendering a graphic.

In this example, invoking a series of transforms prior to drawing the
arrow repositions, rotates, and shrinks it.  (The second example
highlights the transformed coordinate space.)

\table

\row

\li

\image canvasTrans.png

\li

\image canvasTrans2.png

\li

```
var deg = 120;
cx.translate(180,240);
cx.rotate((Math.PI/180) * deg); // requires radians
cx.scale(0.5, 0.5);

// show original dimensions:
cx.strokeStyle = 'gold';
cx.lineWidth = 4;;
cx.strokeRect(0, 0, cv.width, cv.height);
```

\endtable

Unlike CSS, subsequent transforms appear _relative_ to the current
transformed space, so resetting each to default values has no effect.
To reset transforms to their original state, use `setTransform()` to
specify a two-dimensional _matrix_ using default values:

```
setTransform(1,0,0,1,0,0);
```

Matrixes provide an alternative mathematical representation that
consolidates individual transform effects.  The `transform()` method
also accepts a 2D matrix, but makes only relative changes, as with
`translate()`, `rotate()`, and `scale()`. (See the
\l{Use Advanced CSS Formatting} {section on Level 3 CSS} for an
interactive demonstration of 2D matrix transforms.)

The `save()` method provides an alternate way to control transforms
and other global properties. It pushes the current transform onto a
stack of application states, and the `restore()` method pops the
previous state. This example performs the same transform as above, but
returns the canvas to its original state:

```
// ...render graphics within default coordinates...
cx.save();
var deg = 120;
cx.translate(180,240);
cx.rotate((Math.PI/180) * deg);
cx.scale(0.5, 0.5);
// ...render arrow within transformed coordinates...
cx.restore();
// ...render subsequent graphics within default coordinates...
```

Along with transforms, most of canvas's global properties can be
altered and restored in this fashion.

##  Placing Text

Text behaves much the same as paths, applying the same global
`fillText()` and `strokeText()` values as shapes you define.  The
`font()` method accepts the same syntax as shorthand CSS font
properties, but with no support for \l{Typography} {custom
fonts}:

\table

\row

\li

\image canvasText.png

\li

```
cx.fillStyle = 'red';
cx.strokeStyle = 'black';
cx.lineWidth = 1;

cx.textBaseline = 'bottom';
cx.font = 'bold 40px sans-serif';
cx.fillText('You Are Here', 30, 100);
cx.strokeText('You Are Here', 30, 100);
```

\endtable

Text appears at the specified coordinates, with `textBaseline`
controlling how it is placed relative to the horizontal line starting
from the _y_ coordinate.  The `alphabetic` baseline is a standard
for Roman fonts, excluding descenders, and `ideographic` provides
similar metrics to align CJK characters.  The `top` and `bottom`
baselines provide clearance around descenders and various accent
marks, and `middle` falls between those two lines.  The `hanging`
baseline is for Indic scripts that fall from a baseline in much the
same way that Roman characters rise from it.

Canvas does not provide any native method to wrap text. To check if
text fits within the available area, use the `measureText()` method,
testing the returned `TextMetrics` object's `width` value:

\table

\row

\li

\image canvasTextMetric.png

\li

```
if (cx.measureText('This is Where You Are').width > 250) {
    cx.textAlign = 'center';
    // 1st line:
    cx.fillText('This is Where', 160, 100);
    cx.strokeText('This is Where', 160, 100);
    // 2nd line:
    cx.fillText('You Are', 160, 150);
    cx.strokeText('You Are', 160, 150);
}
```

\endtable

The `textAlign()` method specifies how text flows relative to the
supplied _x_ coordinate.  It accepts `left`, `right`, `center`
values, or locale-independent variants `start` or `end`.

##  Line Effects, Shadows, Gradients, and Patterns

The `lineJoin` property affects how angles appear along a path. It
accepts `round`, `bevel`, and the default `miter` as values.
With the `lineJoin` set to `miter`, setting an accompanying
`miterLimit` limits the extent to which corners can extend from the
joint before they are beveled. In this case, it affects only sharper
exterior angles, not the square interior angles, or the path's origin
point at the top of the arrow:

\table

\row

\li

```
cx.lineJoin = 'round';
```

\image canvasRound.png

\li

```
cx.lineJoin = 'bevel';
```

\image canvasBevel.png

\li

```
cx.lineJoin = 'miter';
```

\image canvasMiter.png

\li

```
cx.lineJoin = 'miter';
cx.miterLimit = 2;
```

\image canvasMiterLimit.png

\endtable

The `lineCap` property affects how the end of a line appears. These
examples show how various cap styles appear relative to the underlying
line:

\inlineimage canvasCapButt.png
`cx.lineCap = "butt";`

\inlineimage canvasCapSquare.png
`cx.lineCap = "square";`

\inlineimage canvasCapRound.png
`cx.lineCap = "round";`

Shadows apply to both fill and stroke effects, and are controlled with
`shadowColor`, `shadowOffsetX`, `shadowOffsetY`, and
`shadowBlur` methods. These examples show a crisp offset shadow
along with a nono-offset blur:

\table

\row

\li

\image canvasShadow.png

\li

```
cx.fillStyle = 'red';
cx.shadowColor = '#777777';
cx.shadowOffsetX = 6;
cx.shadowOffsetY = 4;
cx.fill();
```

\li

\image canvasShadowBlur.png

\li

```
cx.fillStyle = 'red';
cx.shadowColor = 'black';
cx.shadowBlur = 10;
cx.fill();
```

\endtable

Gradients can substitute for standard fill abd stroke colors. The
`createLinearGradient()` method defines start and end coordinates
marking the gradient's dimensions. The `CanvasGradient` object it
returns can be assigned to the `fillStyle()` method.  The
`addColorStop()` method defines colors for start and end states, and
any others along the way. If the gradient's dimensions are smaller
than the element it's used to fill, start and end colors extend to the
edge.  This example applies a transparent gradient to the bottom of
the arrow, tapering off from approximately midway across the shape:

\table

\row

\li

\image canvasGradient.png

\li

```
var g = cx.createLinearGradient(65,0,65,225);
g.addColorStop(0, 'red');
g.addColorStop(0.5, 'red');
g.addColorStop(1, 'transparent');
cx.fillStyle = g;
cx.fill();
```

\endtable

The `createRadialGradient()` method requires six arguments: two sets
of _x_/_y_ coordinates and radius of each circle, but otherwise
functions the same. This example renders a series of concentric color
stops, slightly off center, within a clipped circle.

\table

\row

\li

\image canvasGradientRadial.png

\li

```
var g = cx.createRadialGradient(100, 100, 80, 100, 80, 30);
g.addColorStop(0, 'pink');
g.addColorStop(0.25, 'lightblue');
g.addColorStop(0.5, 'gold');
g.addColorStop(0.75, 'lightgreen');
g.addColorStop(1, 'plum');
cx.fillStyle = g;

cx.beginPath();
cx.arc(100, 100, 90, 0, (Math.PI*2));
cx.closePath()
cx.clip();
cx.fill();
```

\endtable

The `createPattern()` method offers another way to import images as
repeating fill patterns. It accepts `repeat-x`, `repeat-y`,
`repeat` (the default), and `no-repeat` as valid options.

\table

\row

\li

\image canvasPattern.png

\li

```
var img = new Image();
img.src = "img/iconPattern.png";
var pattern = cx.createPattern(img, 'repeat');
cx.fillStyle = pattern;
cx.stroke();
cx.fill();
```

\endtable

##  Compositing

The `globalCompositeOperation` property changes how new graphics
interact with what is already on the canvas. The default composite
value is `source-over`:

```
cx.globalCompositeOperation = 'source-over';
```

The `globalAlpha` property specifies overall opacity for newly
rendered graphics:

```
cx.globalAlpha = 0.7; // semi-transparent
```

Here is how it looks when you place a new image (the _source_) over
an existing canvas graphic element (the _destination_) under various
`globalCompositeOperation` settings:

\table

\row

\li
`source-over`
\image canvasCompSourceOver.png
\li
`source-in`
\image canvasCompSourceIn.png
\li
`source-out`
\image canvasCompSourceOut.png
\li
`source-atop`
\image canvasCompSourceAtop.png

\row

\li
`destination-over`
\image canvasCompDestOver.png
\li
`destination-in`
\image canvasCompDestIn.png
\li
`destination-out`
\image canvasCompDestOut.png
\li
`destination-atop`
\image canvasCompDestAtop.png

\row

\li
`copy`
\image canvasCompCopy.png
\li
`lighter`
\image canvasCompLighter.png
\li
`xor`
\image canvasCompXor.png

\endtable

##  Editing Selections

The `imageData` interface allows you to extract and replace
rectangular selections within the canvas, and modify the pixel data.

The `getImageData()` method uses standard x/y offset and
width/height arguments.  The following extracts the entire canvas:

```
var imgData = cx.getImageData(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
```

Alternately, the `createImageData()` method makes a new, blank image
with specified dimensions, which become available as `width` and
`height`:

```
var imgData = cx.createImageData(w,h);
// imgData.width == w;
// imgData.height == y;
```

The `data` property gives you access to the image's pixel data. This
yields a `CanvasPixelArray` object, a flat array that uses four
values to represent each pixel, corresponding to red, green, blue, and
alpha transparency values. This shows how to quickly access component
color values for each pixel:

```
var imgData = cx.getImageData(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
var data = imgData.data; // data is CanvasPixelArray
var r,g,b,a;
for (var i = 0; l = data.length; i += 4) {
   r = data[i];
   g = data[i+1];
   b = data[i+2];
   a = data[i+3];
}
```

You can also access pixel values in terms of the image's `width` and
`height`:

```
var imgData = cx.getImageData(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
var data = imgData.data;
var w = imgData.width;
var h = imgData.height;
var r, g, b, a;
for (var y = 0; y < h; y++) {
    for (var x = 0; x < w; x++) {
       r = data[((w * y) + x) * 4];
       g = data[((w * y) + x) * 4 + 1];
       b = data[((w * y) + x) * 4 + 2];
       a = data[((w * y) + x) * 4 + 3];
    }
}
```

To place the edited selection onto the canvas, the `putImageData()`
method works the same as `Reading and Writing Images` {the
`drawImage()` method described above}. The simple form positions the
image at offsets `x` and `y`:

```
cx.putImageData(imgData, x, y);
```

This extracts a region from within the image, defined by `iw` and
`ih`:

```
cx.putImageData(imgData, x, y, iw, ih);
```

This specifies both offsets (`ix`, `iy`) and dimensions (`iw`,
`ih`) within the image selection:

```
cx.putImageData(imgData, x, y, ix, iy, iw, ih);
```

##  Canvas from CSS

On WebKit-based browsers, canvases can be referenced as background
images. The `getCSSCanvasContext()` method allows you to create a
canvas object directly within JavaScript, then reference its
identifier ("shape" in this case) as a static image from within CSS:

```
<script>
var cx = document.getCSSCanvasContext('2d', 'shape', 320, 370);
// ...draw shape
</script>

<style>
div { background-image: -webkit-canvas(shape) }
</style>
```
