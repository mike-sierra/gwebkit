\title Orientation and Motion

In addition to simple 90\Edeg \l{Tipping the Handset}
{shifts between portrait and landscape orientation}, the browser can
respond to much finer and more complex gestures, using three
dimensional readings from the device's compass and accelerometer.

\section1 Compass Data

The device's compass measures its \e{orientation} in space, relative
to the Earth's magnetic field. Data from the compass is available via
the window's \c{deviceorientation} event, which yields three values:

\list

\li \c{event.alpha} measures simple geographic orientation as rotations
around the device's \e{z} axis. With the device level to the ground,
pointing it in different directions yields an \c{alpha} of \Eplumin
180\Edeg, with zero at magnetic south.

\li \c{event.beta} measures any additional tipping (\e{pitch}) of the
device along its \e{x} axis, also \Eplumin 180\Edeg.  When users stand
and look down at the device they hold, a typical \c{beta} value is
45\Edeg.

\li \c{event.gamma} measures any additional side-to-side \e{roll} along
the device's \e{y} axis, \Eplumin 90\Edeg.

\endlist

The device's orientation is represented as the accumulated sequence of
these three angles. This figure shows \c{alpha} as a \e{z} rotation,
\c{beta} as \e{x}, and \c{gamma} as \e{y}:

\section1 Accelerometer Data

The device's accelerometer measures gravitational forces, including
the Earth's strong gravitational pull, and not confined to relative
\e{motion} through space.

The accelerometer's readings are available via the window's
\c{devicemotion} event. Each of the device's axes is measured in
tenths of a gravitational unit (\e{g}):

\list

\li \c{event.acceleration.x} for horizontal motion, such as
side-to-side shaking. If the device rests on its left or right
edges, respective \e{x}/\e{y}/\e{z} readings are \c{-10}/\c{0}/\c{0}
or \c{10}/\c{0}/\c{0}.

\li \c{event.acceleration.y} for vertical motion. If the device rests
on its bottom or top edges, respective \e{x}/\e{y}/\e{z} readings are
\c{0}/\c{-10}/\c{0} or \c{0}/\c{10}/\c{0}.

\li \c{event.acceleration.z} for forwards or backwards motions. If the
device is face up or face down, respective \e{x}/\e{y}/\e{z} readings
are \c{0}/\c{0}/\c{-10} or \c{0}/\c{0}/\c{10}.

\endlist

The \c{devicemotion} event also produces \e{x}/\e{y}/\e{z} readings
for \c{event.accelerationIncludingGravity}, which is intended to
distinguish accelerometer from gyroscope readings. Since the device
does not feature a gyroscope, these values match those of
\c{event.acceleration}.

This figure shows the accelerometer's coordinate system:

\section1 Example

This example uses accelerometer readings to enter a game-like gestural
application mode in which the main reading panel tips and sways based
on compass readings, and otherwise static icons organize themselves
into a cube that rotates in space. (The main operating mode can be
previewed with Google Chrome running on a laptop.)

\l{x_gesture_htm} {
  \inlineimage gesture1.png
  \inlineimage gesture2.png
}

\l{x_gesture_htm} {
    __IFRAME__
}
\l{x_gesture_htm} {
    \inlineimage icon_html.png
}
\l{x_gesture_css} {
    \inlineimage icon_css.png
}
\l{x_gesture_js} {
    \inlineimage icon_js.png
}

A quick pulling gesture along the device's \e{z} axis towards the
user enters the mode, and a pushing gesture leaves it. It uses a
simple system to distinguish such quick motions from orientation
shifts: comparing \c{acceleration.z} values from those cached from the
previous \c{devicemotion} event. Only when the difference exceeds a
certain threshold does the application change modes, which is unlikely
to occur from relatively slower shifts in the device's orientation.

The main operating mode reflects the \c{deviceorientation} event's
\c{beta} and \c{gamma} values as \e{x}/\e{y} rotations, as well as
other \l{Transforms} {3D transforms}. Each
event modifies various elements' \c{WebkitTransform} CSS property
directly, and additional
\l{Animations} {CSS transitions} smooth out each animation.

\section1 Setting a Threshold

Once initiated, the open-ended gestural interface mode shown above
moves screen elements continuously depending on the device's tilt in
relation to the ground.  Alternately, you may want to enhance a more
conventional interface with relatively unobtrusive gesture-triggered
functions. To do so may require entering a mode within which gestural
shifts are assigned significance. Setting a threshold prevents the
interface from responding too sensitively.

The following simple example (also viewable within Google Chrome on a
laptop) displays orientation state within two \c{meter} elements, but
only after you touch the button at the bottom of the screen.  Each
meter alerts you when the device tilts past a certain threshold
relative to that initial orientation. Use the sliding controls to
modify this threshold.

}
\l{x_gestureMode_css} {
    \inlineimage icon_css.png
}
\l{x_gestureMode_js} {
    \inlineimage icon_js.png
}

A \c{deviceorientation} handler updates the HTML5 \c{<meter>} tags,
whose values are set to display only when the button is pressed:

\code
var meterBeta = document.querySelector('meter:first-of-type');
var meterGamma = document.querySelector('meter:last-of-type');
window.addEventListener('deviceorientation', adjustMeters);

function adjustMeters(e) {
    meterBeta.value = e.beta;
    meterGamma.value = e.gamma;
}
\endcode

A touch handler assigns the meter's \c{optimum} value based on current
orientation, along with \c{low} and \c{high} values outside of which
the meter changes color:

\code
var thresholdX = 10;
var thresholdY = 10;
app.button.addEventListener('touchstart', enterMode);

function enterMode(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    var oGamma, oBeta;
    oGamma = meterGamma.optimum = meterGamma.value;
    oBeta = meterBeta.optimum = meterBeta.value;
    meterGamma.low = oGamma - thresholdX;
    meterBeta.low = oBeta - thresholdY;
    meterGamma.high = oGamma + thresholdX;
    meterBeta.high = oBeta + thresholdY;
}
\endcode

\section1 XXX 8.5 Device Gesture

As shown in \l{Tipping the Handset}, applications can respond to
simple 90-degree shifts in orientation when users tip the handset
between portrait and landscape view.  This section shows how to
interpret data from the handset's various sensors \Emdash compass,
accelerometer, and possibly gyroscope \Emdash to detect more detailed
movements, such as tipping or shaking gestures.  It demonstrates how
gestural operating modes may help enhance an application without
interfering with access to core functionality.

\section2 >>> Accelerometer and Gyroscope Input

\code
window.addEventListener('devicemotion', function(event) {
    event.acceleration.x; // horizontal
    event.acceleration.y; // vertical
    event.acceleration.z; // front-to-back
});
\endcode

\section3 ooo Orientation and Motion

Browser 8_5 allows web apps to respond to simple 90-degree shifts in
device orientation via the \c{orientation} media query or the window's
\c{orientationchange} event. It also enables far more detailed access
to Nokia N9's accelerometer and compass sensors via the
DeviceOrientation API. These sensor values enable a wide variety of
gestural interfaces, and may provide additional context for
location-based applications.

The N9's accelerometer detects forceful motions initiated by users,
such as shaking gestures, along with the Earth's background gravity.
Readings are available via the window's \c{devicemotion} event, whose
\c{event.accelerationIncludingGravity} yields \c{x}, \c{y}, and \c{z}
values. This coordinate system is similar to that used to position
screen elements, with \e{x} increasing from left to right, but with
\e{y} increasing bottom to top. Readings along the \e{z} axis increase
outward from the face of the screen. Units are measured in tenths of a
G, resulting in the following \e{x}/\e{y}/\e{z} readings for the
handset at rest:

\list

\li Face up: \c{0}, \c{0}, \c{-10}

\li Face down: \c{0}, \c{0}, \c{10}

\li Standing on bottom edge: \c{0}, \c{-10}, \c{0}

\li Standing on top edge: \c{0}, \c{10}, \c{0}

\li Standing on left edge: \c{-10}, \c{0}, \c{0}

\li Standing on right edge: \c{10}, \c{0}, \c{0}

\endlist

The range of values from \c{devicemotion} events is illustrated below:

\note Because the Nokia N9 does not have a gyroscope, readings from
\c{event.acceleration} match those of
\c{event.accelerationIncludingGravity}, and they cannot reliably
detect motion independently of earth's gravity. To test whether
\c{acceleration} readings are derived from a gyroscope, perform an
initial test if the \e{x}/\e{y}/\e{z} values for each match. If so,
applications may need to filter out earth's gravity to calculate
relative motion.

While accelerometer readings can be used in some cases to determine
orientation relative to earth's gravity, compass readings are
necessary for overall geospatial orientation. Compass readings are
available via the window's \c{deviceorientation} event:

\list

\li \c{event.alpha} measures rotation around the \e{z} axis in degrees.
A value of \c{0} means the top edge of the Nokia N9 is pointing south,
while \c{180} or \c{-180} is north.

\li \c{event.beta} measures rotation around the \e{x} axis, with a
range of \c{-180} to \c{180} degrees relative to a face-up
orientation.  If the Nokia N9 is standing on its bottom edge, the
\c{beta} is \c{90}.

\li \c{event.gamma} measures rotation around the \e{y} axis, with a
range of \c{-180} to \c{180} degrees relative to a face-up
orientation.  If the Nokia N9 is standing on its left or right edges,
the \c{gamma} is \c{-90} and \c{90}, correspondingly.

\endlist

The range of values from \c{deviceorientation} events is illustrated
below:

\note By default, when tipping the Nokia N9, Browser 8_5 shifts content from
portrait to landscape display and back. There is no standard way to
lock orientation to prevent conflicts with orientation- or
motion-driven applications.

\section3 ooo Gestural interface modes

Motion- and orientation-enabled applications should be sensitive to
the context in which they operate. Most gaming applications, for
example, effectively have a single mode of operation. The following
example shows how tilting gestures affect a flight simulator
application:

\image orient_game.png

Gestures may also be used to marginally supplement more conventional
functionality. The example shown in \sub{The execCommand editing API}
section illustrates how gestures may help users edit text elements.
Such gestural modes work best by setting a \e{threshold} at which
gestures take effect. Since hidden gestural modes are relatively
unfamiliar and may lead to unintended results, applications should
offer them on an optional basis.

In this case, when tapping within an editable content block, a
\c{focus} handler would capture the initial degree of tilt against
which subsequent gestures would be measured.

\code
function focusHandler(e) {
    isEditing = true;
    initialTilt = currentTilt;
}
function blurHandler(e) {
    isEditing = false;
}
\endcode

Subsequent executions of the \c{deviceorientation} handler would
ignore gestures within a specified threshold:

\code
function deviceorientationHandler(e) {
    currentTilt = e.gamma;
    if (! isEditing) return(false);
    if (! prefersGesturalEditing) return(false);
    var tiltThreshold = 20; // degree variance to trigger editing
    if ( (currentTilt < (initialTilt + tiltThreshold) ) &&
        ( (currentTilt > (initialTilt - tiltThreshold) ) ) ) {
        return(false); // gesture is within threshold; ignore
    }
    else if (currentTilt < initialTilt) {
        // left-tilting gesture outside threshold:
        document.execCommand('delete');
    }
    else if (currentTilt > initialTilt)
        // right-tilting gesture outside threshold:
        document.execCommand('forwardDelete');
    }
}
\endcode

This sample application allows users who are editing text to tilt the
handset to delete characters more easily. Unlike the gaming scenario
noted above, users can be assumed to hold the handset relatively still
when entering the text-editing mode, because they would need to press
keyboard buttons. Users who choose to enable such a gestural mode may
then find it natural to tilt the device relative to that initial
position.
