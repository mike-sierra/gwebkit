# Transforms

CSS _transforms_ allow interface elements to be moved from their
default location, rotated, or scaled. The Browser supports both two-
and three-dimensional transforms. Transform _properties_ specify any
number of transform _functions_:

- Move elements horizontally (_x_), vertically (_y_), or
back-to-front (_z_): `translate(x,y)`, `translateX(x)`,
`translateY(y)`, `translateZ(z)`, or `translate3d(x,y,z)`.
Movements along the _z_ axis must correspond to pixel units.

- Shrink/expand elements, in decimal terms with 1 as normal size.
The following allow you to scale each axis independently:
`scale(x,y)`, `scaleX(x)`, `scaleY(y)`.  Otherwise specifying
`scale(n)` with a single numeric argument maintains the original
aspect ratio.

- Rotate elements, specifying either degree (`deg`) or radian
(`rad`) measurements: `rotate(z)`, `rotateZ(z)`, `rotateX(x)`,
`rotateY(y)`. An additional `rotate3d()` function requires three
numeric arguments that define a 3D vector, followed by a fourth
argument representing the degree of rotation around that line.

- Two-dimensional _skew_ transforms, which also accept `deg` or
`rad` measurements, distort the element's default right-angle
corners, changing the rectangle to a parallelogram: `skewX()` for
the sides of the element to wobble, or `skewY` for the top or
bottom to wobble.

Applications can animate transforms dynamically using JavaScript, or
using \l{Animations} {CSS transitions and keyframes}.

In this example, the main content panel tips and sways along with the
device:

\l{x_gesture_htm} {
  \inlineimage gesture1.png
  \inlineimage gesture2.png
}

\l{x_gesture_htm} {
    __IFRAME__
}
\l{x_gesture_htm} {
    \inlineimage icon_html.png
}
\l{x_gesture_css} {
    \inlineimage icon_css.png
}
\l{x_gesture_js} {
    \inlineimage icon_js.png
}

Readings from the \l{Orientation and Motion} {3D compass}
are translated directly to rotations along the screen element's _x_
and _y_ axes. This is how to represent such a transform as static
CSS:

```
.panel {
    -webkit-transform: rotateX(12deg) rotateY(-4deg);
    -webkit-transition: all 0.5s;
    transform: rotateX(12deg) rotateY(-4deg);
    transition: all 0.5s;
}
```

> __NOTE__: Many Level 3 CSS properties use _vendor prefixes_ such as
`-webkit-` to indicate they have not been finalized as a web
standard. To ensure future coverage, specify the same set of
properties without the prefix.

The \l{Animations} {transition} smoothes the
transform's appearance when it is animated dynamically via JavaScript,
as in this alternative example:

```
var p = document.querySelector('.panel');
p.style.WebkitTransform = 'rotateX(' + x + 'deg) rotateY(' + y + 'deg)';
```

For flat elements to assume a 3D appearance, they must be nested within a
parent element that has _perspective_ applied to it:

```
section {
    -webkit-perspective: 1000;
    -webkit-perspective-origin: 50% 50%;
}
```

The perspective value refers to the number of pixels along the _z_
axis between the viewer and the screen. The perspective _origin_
refers to the _x_/_y_ position along the surface of the element
from which the viewer appears to back away. (Here it reflects the
default `center` value.)

Elements that are transformed in 3D space may align to a plane that is
different than that of the viewing screen. If that element specifies
`preserve-3d`, any children transform within the 3D space it
defines, rather than appearing `flat` by default:

```
.gesture {
    -webkit-transform-style: preserve-3d;
}
```

In the example above, the cube's _z_-axis translation makes it
appear to move towards the viewer:

```
.gesture > ol {
    -webkit-transform: translateZ(800px);
}
```

As the main panel wobbles slightly, the cube appears to move more
dramatically in relation to the panel.

The cube itself defines its own nested 3D space. Four of the faces are
postioned with 90\Edeg rotations. By default, transforms _originate_
from the `center` of the element, but modifying the
`-webkit-transform-origin` allows each face to hinge along the
`left`, `right`, `top`, or `bottom` edges. (These correspond
to standard _x_/_y_ measurements, so that `bottom` can also be
represented as `50% 100%`.) The back face is rotated 180\Edeg
around a point behind it, so it moves backwards.

```
.gesture > ol > li:nth-of-type(1) {
    -webkit-transform: translateZ(0%);
}
.gesture > ol > li:nth-of-type(2) {
    -webkit-transform-origin: left;
    -webkit-transform: rotateY(90deg);
}
.gesture > ol > li:nth-of-type(3) {
    -webkit-transform-origin: right;
    -webkit-transform: rotateY(-90deg);
}
.gesture > ol > li:nth-of-type(4) {
    -webkit-transform-origin: top;
    -webkit-transform: rotateX(-90deg);
}
.gesture > ol > li:nth-of-type(5) {
    -webkit-transform-origin: bottom;
    -webkit-transform: rotateX(90deg);
}
.gesture > ol > li:nth-of-type(6) {
    -webkit-transform-origin: 50% 50% -18px;
    -webkit-transform: rotateY(180deg);
}
```

To implement flip-panel effects, items that rotate away from view can
be hidden; otherwise they appear as a mirror image:

```
ol {
    -webkit-backface: hidden;
}
```

###  SIDEBAR CSS3 Selectors

Browser 8.5 supports all Level 3 CSS Selectors:

- Indirect siblings: `element ~ successors`

- Matching attribute values: `[attr^="prefix"]`,
`[attr$="suffix"]`, `[attr*="substring"]`

- Positional classes: `:first-child`, `:last-child`,
`:nth-child()`, `:nth-first-child()`, `:nth-last-child()`,
`:only-child`

- Contextual classes: `:first-of-type`, `:last-of-type`,
`:nth-first-of-type()`, `:nth-last-of-type()`, `:nth-of-type()`,
`:only-of-type`

- Form input state classes: `:valid`, `:invalid`,
`:focus`, `:checked`, `:enabled`,
`:disabled`

- Navigational class: `:target`

- Other classes: `:empty`, `:root`, `:not()`

##  XXX pre

Transforms offer visual effects that manipulate the appearance of
screen elements, perhaps displacing them from where they would
otherwise appear. Otherwise static transform effects work in
conjunction with CSS \l{Animations} {transitions and keyframe
animations} to build dynamic interfaces. This section provides a
brief guide on how to apply two- and three-dimensional CSS transforms
to supporting browsers, and interactive tools to experiment with
transform effects.

###  2D Transforms

CSS transform properties specify any of four basic functions:

- `translate()` moves an element around on the screen.  It accepts
two _x_/_y_ valid CSS measurements, which can also be expressed as
separate `translateX()` and `translateY()` functions.

- `scale()` resizes an element. It accepts decimal values, with 1
representing the element's default size. If the element's scale is 2,
it is double its original size, and if it is 0, it disappears.
Alternative `scaleX()` and `scaleY()` functions allow width and
height to be manipulated independently.

- `rotate()` spins an element around its _z_ axis.  It accepts a
degree (`deg`) or radian (`rad`) measurement. (Radians are
equivalent to the number of degrees multiplied by \Epi/180.)

- `skew()` distorts an element's appearance by modifying its
default corner angles, with positive measurements increasing the
bottom-left corner angle. It accepts two degree (`deg`) or radian
(`rad`) measurements, or else can be expressed separately as
`skewX()` and `skewY()` functions.  Skews along the _x_ axis tip
the side edges of the element, while skews along _y_ tip the top and
bottom.

Browsers represent combinations of transform functions internally as a
two-dimensional _matrix_, which for two dimensions consists of six
values. Applications can manipulate transforms using this alternative
`matrix()` function.  (For a useful summary of matrix syntax, read
the _eleqtriq.com_ article,
[The Matrix Revolutions](http://www.eleqtriq.com/2010/05/css-3d-matrix-transformations/).)

The following interactive utility shows the effect of various
transform functions on an image, and how they may be expressed as a
combined `matrix()` function. In addition to displaying the overall
effect, it produces the CSS code necessary to produce it:

\l{x_utilTransform2D} {\inlineimage utilTransform2D.png
}

> __NOTE__: Transform functions can't be combined or inherited from different
selectors. Specifying only a `rotate()` function, for example,
implies `translate()` and `scale()` values of zero.

###  The Transform Origin

Unless otherwise specified, transforms _originate_ from the center
of the element. If you scale it down, for example, it shrinks towards
the center. The `-webkit-transform-origin` property allows this
origin point to be placed elsewhere.

Transforms cannot be applied to regular inline text, but if you apply
the following `skew()` transform to an `inline-block`, it
simulates an italic effect in which the top edge shifts to the right,
while the bottom edge remains fixed in place:

```
-webkit-transform        : skewX(-10deg);
-webkit-transform-origin : bottom;
display                  : inline-block;
```

The utility \l{2D Transforms} {shown above} shows how a transform may
be affected by its origin point. The `-webkit-transform-origin`
property accepts pairs of _x_/_y_ CSS measurements, but also
recognizes `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` keywords.
(The `center` keyword is the same as `50% 50%`.)  Alternately,
`-webkit-transform-origin-x` and `-webkit-transform-origin-y`
properties specify each axis separately.

This touch-enabled image gallery example relies on a simple
`rotate()` transform.  Moving the origin point far underneath the
element (150% along _y_) makes each image appear to be part of a
large wheel:

\table

\row

\li

\l{x_event_touch-crop-rotate} {\inlineimage scr_event_touch-crop-rotate.png
}

\l{x_event_touch-crop-rotate_css} {\inlineimage icon_css.png
}

\li

```
canvas {
  -webkit-transform-origin : 50% 150%;
  -webkit-transform        : rotate(90deg);
}
```

\endtable

This somewhat more complex variation uses `scaleX()` transforms, but
with different origin points depending on whether items appear to
collapse to the left or right. A \l{Transitional Sequences} {sequence
of two transitions} shifts the origin point before or after the
transform animates, depending on whether the transition navigates
towards or away from the _selected_ state:

\table

\row

\li

\l{x_event_touch-crop-scale} {\inlineimage scr_event_touch-crop-scale.png
}

\l{x_event_touch-crop-scale_css} {\inlineimage icon_css.png
}

\li

```
canvas {
    -webkit-transform           : scaleX(0);
    -webkit-transform-origin    : right;
    -webkit-transition-property : -webkit-transform-origin , -webkit-transform;
    -webkit-transition-duration : 0s                       , 0.75s;
    -webkit-transition-delay    : 0s                       , 0.25s;
}

.stage_left {
    -webkit-transform-origin    : left;
}
.stage_right {
    -webkit-transform-origin    : right;
}

.selected {
    -webkit-transform           : scaleX(1);
    -webkit-transition-property : -webkit-transform , -webkit-transform-origin;
    -webkit-transition-duration : 0.5s              , 0s;
    -webkit-transition-delay    : 0.5s              , 1s;
}
```

\endtable

###  3D Transforms

Though they often take on the illusion of three dimensions, 2D
transforms are strictly superficial, inhabiting the plane of the
handset's screen. Three dimensional transforms allow content to shift
onto other planes.

To accomplish this effect, applying a _perspective_ to an an
ancestor element indicates the perceived distance from the viewer of
any transformed descendents. The `-webkit-perspective` property
specifies CSS pixels along the handset's _z_ axis that leads to the
viewer, otherwise its default value of c{none} indicates infinite
perspective, which appears flat.

```
.parent {
    -webkit-perspective : 1000;
    -webkit-perspective-origin : 50% 50%;
}
.child {
    -webkit-transform: rotateY(30deg);
}
```

While `-webkit-perspective` affects the perceived distance to an
object along the _z_ axis, the `-webkit-perspective-origin`
property shift the perceived _x_/_y_ location from which it is
viewed. The default value is shown above: the element is viewed
at its center rather than towards its edges.

Since web content is flat be default, all measurements along the _z_
axis must specify absolute units, whose appearance is affected by how
much perspective is applied. Perspective values less than 1000 appear
increasingly distorted. Exceptions may include immersive virtual
reality applications in which the viewer appears to mingle among
displaying elements.

The following touch-enabled image gallery demonstrates a
perspective-enabled 3D rotation:

\l{x_event_touch-crop} {\inlineimage scr_event_touch-crop2.png
}

\l{x_event_touch-crop_css} {\inlineimage icon_css.png
}

The following set of functions specify three-dimensional transforms:

- `rotateX()` and `rotateY()` spin elements around their
horizontal or vertical axis. The `rotateZ()` function behaves the
same as the 2D `rotate()` function. An alternative `rotate3d()`
function requires four arguments. The first three measurements specify
a point defining a 3D vector from the origin of the element. (For
example, setting the vector to `0,1,0` rotates the object entirely
around its _y_ axis.) The fourth argument specifies the angle of
rotation around that vector, using `deg` or `rad` measurements.

- The `translate3d()` function requires three _x_, _y_ and
_z_ measurements. Otherwise, use any combination of
`translateX()`, `translateY()`, and `translateZ()` functions.
Since web content is flat by default, the _z_ translation must
specify absolute measurements. The perceived movement towards or away
from the viewer depends on how much perspective is applied.

- The `scale3d()` function accepts three _x_, _y_ and _z_
measurements, otherwise they can be specified separately with
`scaleX()`, `scaleY()`, and `scaleZ()`.  Unlike standard _x_
and _y_ measurements, the _z_ measurement closes the distance to
transformed children. (See \l{Nested 3D Transforms} for a
demonstration.)

The `-webkit-transform-origin` property accepts an additional third
`z` measurement to place the transformation point behind or in front
of where the element displays, in absolute units. (Alternately,
specify the `-webkit-transform-origin-z` property,)

Elements that rotate away from view display as a mirror image by
default. Changing the `-webkit-backface-visibility` property to
`hidden` (from `visible`) enables flip-panel effects in which
elements are only visible if they face the viewer.

The following interactive utility shows how these 3D transform
functions interact with each other:

\l{x_utilTransform3d} {\inlineimage utilTransform3d.png
}

While 2D transforms can be represented as a 6-element `matrix()`
function, 3D transforms correspond to 16-element `matrix3d()`
functions. (Read
[The Matrix Revolutions](http://www.eleqtriq.com/2010/05/css-3d-matrix-transformations/) and experiment with the utility above to see
how they work.)

###  Targeting 2D and 3D Transforms

The image gallery \l{x_event_touch-crop} {shown above} specifies a
\l{What Can You Find Out About a Browser?} {CSS media query} to
display a different set of visual effects depending on the browser's
support for 3D transforms. The 2D interface displays a horizontal
swipe, and the 3D interface displays a rotation:

```
canvas {
    -webkit-transform : translateX(150%);
}
@media all and (-webkit-transform-3d) {
    canvas {
        -webkit-transform             : rotateY(90deg);
        -webkit-backface-visibility   : hidden;
    }
}
```

The \l{x_utilTransform3d} {utility above} tests the same \l{Script-based Adaptation} {media query from within JavaScript} to produce an error
message on unsupporting browsers.

Browsers that only support 2D transforms ignore 3D-only functions,
which may allow visual effects to degrade gracefully. The following
two transforms have the same effect on 3D-enabled browsers: moving the
element towards the right and pushing it backwards. Browsers that
only support 2D ignore the first line altogether, but interpret the
`translate()` function from the second line:

```
-webkit-transform: translate3d(120%, 0, -320px);
-webkit-transform: translate(120%, 0) translateZ(-320px);
```

> __NOTE__: It is a good idea to always specify 3D transforms for animating
elements, even if they do not change their appearance in any way.
Mobile handsets are relatively constrained in their processing power,
and may assign hardware that performs _accelerated compositing_ on
3D elements.  For example, adding `translateZ(0)` has no effect on
2D browsers, but may signal 3D browsers to render more quickly.
(Availablility of hardware-accelerated rendering cannot be detected
using media queries.) Such _z_-axis transforms must be reiterated
each time the transform is dynamically modified, otherwise elements
may inefficiently revert to the compositing layer reserved for
conventional 2D rendering.

###  Nested 3D Transforms

Applying a 3D rotation to an element aligns it to a different plane
than that of the default viewing screen. Applying translations and
scale effects also overrides the default coordinate system. Any
nested content can be independently transformed within that modified
space.

To position nested content relative to the transformed parent's own 3D
space, the parent element's `-webkit-transform-style` property must
be set to `preserve-3d`. By default, it is `flat`, making 3D
effects display on the parent's 2D surface as if it were a viewing
screen.

The following interactive utility allows you to experiment with nested
transform effects:

\l{x_utilTransform3dNest} {\inlineimage utilTransform3dNest.png
}

Rotating the parent element moves the child element along with it, but
offset in 3D space using a translation along the Z axis. Setting the
child's _z_ translation to zero, hiding both back faces, then
rotating the parent produces a flip-panel effect.

For the sake of simplicity, the utility above shows how a single
transformed child element may appear relative to its parent. However,
transform effects can cascade down a deeper tree of elements. The
following demonstrates how transform effects can be progressively
magnified within a series of descendent elements:

\l{x_utilTransform3dNest_x8} {\inlineimage utilTransform3dNest_x8.png
}

The default _z_ translation makes the images appear expanded like an
accordion or a deck of cards, but the dynamic effect shown in the
image above comes from slight manipulations to the descendents' scale
and rotation transforms.

> __NOTE__: This example shows `perspective()` used as a transform function.
Conceptually, perspective is best applied to the parent element when
potentially many children must inherit the same value. However, this
example demonstrates that individual children may receive their own
independent perspectives.

###  Example: Spinning Dice

The following example shows how to build gaming dice with nested 3D
transforms, so that the entire object can itself be spun using 3D
transforms:

\l{x_anim_dice} {\inlineimage scr_anim_dice.png
}

\l{x_anim_dice_css} {\inlineimage icon_css.png
}
\l{x_anim_dice_js} {\inlineimage icon_js.png
}

The underlying HTML markup defines a six-element list:

```
<ol class="dice">
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ol>
```

The `<ol>` element serves as a wrapper element, whose
`preserve-3d` defines its own transformation space. Transitions are
enabled in order to allow the dice to render smoothly, and elements of
the dice that face away from view are hidden:

```
.dice {
  -webkit-backface-visibility : hidden;
  -webkit-transform-origin    : 50px 50px -50px;
  -webkit-transform-style     : preserve-3d;
  -webkit-transition          : all 1s ease-in-out;
  padding                     : 0;
}
```

Each side of the dice is a 100-pixel square. Absolute positioning
forces each side to overlay by default:

```
.dice > li {
  position                    : absolute;
  height                      : 100px;
  width                       : 100px;
  background-size             : cover;
  border                      : #aaa 0.1em solid;
  border-radius               : 0.5em;
  list-style-type             : none;
}
```

From that default position, various sides of the dice are transformed
in 3D space.  The first side remains in its default position. Origins
for sides 2 through 5 are shifted from the center point so their
90-degree rotations hinge along their `left`, `right` `bottom`
and `top` edges. The final face is flipped 180 degrees and moved
backwards to close off the cube:

```
.dice > li:nth-of-type(1) {
    -webkit-transform           : translateZ(0px);
    background-image            : url(img/die1.jpg);
}
.dice > li:nth-of-type(2) {
    -webkit-transform           : rotateY(90deg) translateZ(0px);
    -webkit-transform-origin    : left;
    background-image            : url(img/die2.jpg);
}
.dice > li:nth-of-type(3) {
    -webkit-transform           : rotateY(-90deg) translateZ(0px);
    -webkit-transform-origin    : right;
    background-image            : url(img/die3.jpg);
}
.dice > li:nth-of-type(4) {
    -webkit-transform           : rotateX(90deg) translateZ(0px);
    -webkit-transform-origin    : bottom;
    background-image            : url(img/die4.jpg);
}
.dice > li:nth-of-type(5) {
    -webkit-transform           : rotateX(-90deg) translateZ(0px);
    -webkit-transform-origin    : top;
    background-image            : url(img/die5.jpg);
}
.dice > li:nth-of-type(6) {
    -webkit-transform           : rotateX(180deg) translateZ(-100px);
    -webkit-transform-origin    : center;
    background-image            : url(img/die6.jpg);
}
```

Once the final shape of the cube is defined, spinning the entire
object simply requires applying rotation transforms to the outer
_dice_ element that encapulates its visible faces.  See \l{Dynamic Keyframes} for information on how transforms are assigned randomly in
this case. Otherwise, transforms can be applied directly to the
element:

```
var dice = document.querySelector('ol.dice');
dice.style.WebkitTransform = "rotateX(20deg) rotateY(40deg) rotateZ(30deg) translateZ(0)";
```

###  Example: Virtual Reality

The following example shows how 3D transforms can build a rudimentary
virtual reality scene:

\l{x_gesture_virtual} {\inlineimage scr_gesture_virtual.png
}

\l{x_gesture_virtual_css} {\inlineimage icon_css.png
}
\l{x_gesture_virtual_js} {\inlineimage icon_js.png
}

> __NOTE__: The scene can be rotated by tipping the handset, otherwise desktop
browsers simulate gestural navigation.

Like the dice above, the object is built much like a cube. Unlike the
dice, it is pushed forwards to apparently rotate around the viewer.
The following markup and wireframe diagram help clarify how it is
built:

```
<section id="outer">
<div id="rx" data-x="0">
  <div id="ry" data-y="0">
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
  </div>
</div>
</section>
```

\image scr_gesture_virtual_wireframe.png

An _outer_ element appears in the rear of the scene, and corresponds
to the screen dimensions:

```
#outer { width : 480px; height : 320px; }
```

An _rx_ element is positioned far in front of the _outer_ element
using `translateZ()`:

```
#rx { -webkit-transform : translateZ(240px); }
```

The _ry_ element matches the initial position of _ry_, but rotates
freely around a point far in front of it:

```
#ry {    
    -webkit-transform-style	: preserve-3d;
    -webkit-transform-origin-z	: 240px;
}
```

To complete the illusion, each face of the inner box references the
same panoramic image. Each is offset by different amounts using
\l{Backgrounds} {background positioning and sizing properties}. 
For information on how the box spins in response to tipping gestures,
see \l{Orientation and Motion}.
