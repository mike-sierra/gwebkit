# Input Types

Entering text is one of the most difficult parts of using a mobile
handset. Wherever possible, interfaces that solicit users' information
should make data entry as easy as possible. This section suggests ways
to modify non-text form elements to make them easier to use on mobile
handsets.

> __NOTE__: Mobile browsers generally prevent access to the handset's file system,
and do not allow users to upload files, so `file` form inputs are
not supported.

###  Option Lists

Option lists allow users to choose from a known set of alternatives.
Mobile browsers present options lists with a dedicated interface that
renders options much larger than the small popup menu of desktop
browsers. Since users can only see a few options at a time, it is best
to break sets of options into different categories to limit the number
available at any point. The following example shows two option lists,
re-styled to make them easier to touch. The contents of the second
list depend on what is selected from the first:

\l{x_form_option} {\inlineimage scr_form_option.png
}

\l{x_form_option_css} {\inlineimage icon_css.png
}\l{x_form_option_js} {\inlineimage icon_js.png
}

> __NOTE__: HTML tags that present special interfaces, such as pop-up lists, can
often be restyled by disabling their default presentation. Setting
the `-webkit-appearance` property to `none` styles the element as
a plain rectangle, to which other style sheets add a border and
background image.

###  SIDEBAR Form Element State

The `:checked` dynamic class allows you to style radio and checkbox
inputs based on their selection state. This enables the following
mobile-friendly interface, which converts small radio and check boxes
to much more accessible toggle buttons:

\l{x_form_toggler-anim} {\inlineimage scr_form_toggler-anim.png
}

\l{x_form_toggler-anim_css} {\inlineimage icon_css.png
}

In this example, the position of a background image is shifted based
on whether an `input` is `:checked` or not:

```
input[type=radio], input[type=checkbox] {
  -webkit-appearance  : none;
  background-color    : #777777;
  background-image    : url(img/toggle_button.png);
  background-position : 102% 50%;
  background-repeat   : no-repeat;
  background-size     : contain;
}
input[type=radio]:checked, input[type=checkbox]:checked {
  background-position : -2% 50%;
}
```

Note that to display button text, dynamic classes can be chained
together to form more complex expressions:
`input[type=radio]:checked:before`. This example also relies on the
`-webkit-appearance` property, which allows you to override the
default visual presentation of specialized interface elements such as
radio and checkbox inputs. In this case, setting their appearance to
`none` presents them as plain blocks. (See \l{Radio and Checkbox Togglers} for alternative form interfaces. See \l{Transitions} for
information on how the buttons are animated.)

Form elements may also be re-styled based on whether they are
`:enabled` or `:disabled`. In addition, the `:focus` dynamic
class allows you to style text form inputs or other editable content
regions that users have currently selected for editing. The following
example applies a box shadow to any field that is ready to accept
text:

\l{x_form_search} {\inlineimage scr_form_search.png
}

\l{x_form_search_css} {\inlineimage icon_css.png
}

\endquotation

###  Radio and Checkbox Togglers

By default, radio buttons and check boxes render very small and
inaccessible on the mobile screen. CSS3's `:checked` dynamic class
allows them to be re-styled as larger toggle buttons. The following
shows two different ways to implement toggle inputs entirely with CSS:

\table

\row

- \l{x_form_toggler} {\inlineimage scr_form_toggler.png
}

\l{x_form_toggler_css} {\inlineimage icon_css.png
}

- \l{x_form_toggler-anim} {\inlineimage scr_form_toggler-anim.png
}

\l{x_form_toggler-anim_css} {\inlineimage icon_css.png
}

\endtable

Tappable buttons offer another way to improve the interface of radio
buttons and check boxes, which the following example demonstrates:

\l{x_form_tapper} {\inlineimage scr_form_tapper.png
}

\l{x_form_tapper_css} {\inlineimage icon_css.png
}

\omit

###  << Date/Time Inputs

HTML5 also specifies several temporal input types: `date`,
`month`, `week`, `time`, `datetime`, and `datetime-local`.
These validate to various elements of universal time syntax, such as
__0001-01-01T00:00Z__. However, so far only a few browsers support
a custom calendar-style input interface that would make them
practical. Until there is widespread support, it is better to rely on
date picker interfaces supplied by JavaScript frameworks such as
jQuery.

###  << Color Inputs

The `color` input validates to web color names such as _red_,
or hex values such as _#00ffff_. However, WebKit-based browsers do
not yet feature a dedicated color-picker input interface, so you
should avoid these inputs.

###  Range Inputs

HTML5's new `number` form input shown in the \l{Input Validation}
{next section} allows validation of numeric input. In cases when the
range of values is constrained, however, the `range` input prevents
users from having to enter numeric text. Here is a sample:

```
<input type="range" min="0" max="5" value="2.5" step="0.5"/>
```

Specifying numeric `min` and `max` attributes overrides the
default range of 0 to 100. Specifying a numeric `step` attribute
overrides the default incremental value of 1.

While range sliders indicate approximately how far users are between
the minimum and maximum values, they don't provide feedback to
indicate the selected value. The following example fixes this with
some added JavaScript enabled by the input's `change` event:

\l{x_form_range} {\inlineimage scr_form_range.png
}

\l{x_form_range_css} {\inlineimage icon_css.png
}\l{x_form_range_js} {\inlineimage icon_js.png
}

The first example shows how `range` inputs may appear by default.

The second example is re-styled to make the slider handle larger and
more inviting. This component is stylable via a low-level  CSS
_pseudo-element_ class specific to WebKit:

```
input[type="range"]{ -webkit-appearance:none }
input[type="range"]::-webkit-slider-thumb { -webkit-appearance:none }
```

The second example also substitutes the integer with a corresponding
text value, indicating a range of a customer's level of satisfaction.

The third example shows a familiar rating-picker interface that
invites users to tap along the bar rather than drag a slider handle.

###  Progress Trackers and Meters

HTML5's new `progress` and `meter` tags aren't actually form
elements. They are both similar to `range` inputs because the
present a range of numeric values graphically. The major difference is
that they are used for output rather than input.

The `progress` tag is designed to give feedback about any operation
that may involve a noticeable delay, or that requires proceeding
through a sequence of steps. The `meter` tag is similar, but can be
used to alert users about values that fall outside a preferred range.

The following example shows how the `progress` and `meter` tags
appear by default, and by cycling through a series of values each ten
seconds:

```
<progress max="10"/>
<meter min="0" low="4" optimum="5" high="6"  max="10"/>
```

\l{x_form_progmeter} {\inlineimage scr_form_progmeter.png
}

The `progress` tag requires `value` and `max` attributes to
present the relative degree of completion. With no attributes
specified, the `progress` tag displays a continuous animation.

Since HTML5 tags such as `progress` and `meter` are relatively
new, some browsers ignore them altogether. In this case, it is a good
idea to allow the interface to degrade gracefully. The following
example presents a graphic progress bar to browsers that support it,
or raw text to those that don't:

```
<progress id="download" value="245" max="3764">
    <div id="downloadFallback">15</div>%
</progress>
```

The default appearance of the progress tracker or its degree of
completion can be modified with CSS such as the following:

```
progress                         { -webkit-appearance: none; }
progress::-webkit-progress-bar   { background-color: lightblue; }
progress::-webkit-progress-value { background-color: lightgreen; }
```

The following CSS specifies a meter's default background and values
relative to its optimum:

```
meter                                     { -webkit-appearance: none; }
meter::-webkit-meter-bar                  { background: lightblue; }
meter::-webkit-meter-optimum-value        { background: lightgreen; }
meter::-webkit-meter-suboptimum-value     { background: gold; }
meter::-webkit-meter-even-less-good-value { background: pink; }
```

In the following example, JavaScript added to a re-styled progress bar
changes it to an input element:

\l{x_event_orient-gallery} {\inlineimage scr_event_orient-gallery.png
\inlineimage scr_event_orient-gallery2.png
}

\l{x_event_orient-gallery_css} {\inlineimage icon_css.png
}
\l{x_event_orient-gallery_js} {\inlineimage icon_js.png
}
