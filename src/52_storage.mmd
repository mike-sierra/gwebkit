\title Data Storage

Client-side storage is necessary to enable HTML-based applications
that \l{Offline Mode} {operate offline}, and is
desirable to reduce the amount of sensitive data transmitted in
network requests.  The Browser supports simple key/value-based HTML5
\e{web storage} \Emdash \c{localStorage} and \c{sessionStorage}.  For
more complex storage options, see \l{Web SQL}.

\section1 Web Storage

\section1 Web SQL

\section1 ZZZ Simple Web Storage

Web storage has two flavors: \c{localStorage} and \c{sessionStorage}.
Session data is available for each site and for the duration of each
browser window. Local data is available for each site indefinitely,
following termination of the browser application or web app.  Other
than the scope of their data and access via \c{window.localStorage}
and \c{window.sessionStorage} objects, the interface for each API is
identical.

The following illustrates the full set of method calls:

\code
// is client storage available?
if (window.localStorage) {                               
    var db = window.localStorage;
    // get key (If null, doesn't exist):
    var value = JSON.parse( db.getItem("key") );         
    try {
        // set key:
        db.setItem("key", JSON.stringify("new value") ); 
    } catch(err) {
        if (err.QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR) {
            // not enough storage space
        }
    }
    db.removeItem("key"); // delete key
    db.clear();           // delete all keys
}
else {
    // store data remotely?
}
\endcode

Overall storage space is limited to 5MB, which this example accounts
for by checking \c{QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR}. All data is stored in string
format, so converting to and from JSON allows you to avoid other
errors in which data's original \e{type} is lost.

The \c{length} and \c{key} methods allow you to iterate over all keys
using array indexes.  This example mirrors a set of stored items as a
JavaScript object:

\code
var obj = {};
for (var i = 0, l = db.length ; i < l ; i++) {
    obj[db.key(i)] = JSON.parse(db.getItem(db.key(i)));
}
\endcode

Applications can respond to all database changes using \c{storage}
events, which fire on the \c{window} object.  The \c{event.oldValue}
and \c{event.newValue} properties provide both strings.  The
\c{event.key} property returns the name of the key being modified, and
\c{event.storageArea} returns whichever of the \c{window.localStorage}
or \c{window.sessionStorage} databases are affected.  This simple
example presents a visual feedback that data is being stored on the
device:

\code
window.addEventListener("storage", function(e){
    var i = document.querySelector("#storage_indicator");
    (e.storageArea.length)
        ? (i.classlist.add("write"))
        : (i.classlist.remove("write"));
}, false);
\endcode

In this example, users make corrections to text. If they close the
application before completing their work, correct answers are
reflected on the page when they re-open it:

\l{x_editable_htm} {
  \inlineimage editable.png
}

\l{x_editable_htm} {
    __IFRAME__
}
\l{x_editable_htm} {
    \inlineimage icon_html.png
}
\l{x_editable_css} {
    \inlineimage icon_css.png
}
\l{x_editable_js} {
    \inlineimage icon_js.png
}

\section3 ooo Web SQL

Use the Web SQL feature for more advanced SQL-driven database
applications that execute entirely on the client browser, but that
fall beyond the capabilities of the simple key/value-based Web Storage
system described above.

Use \c{openDatabase} to create or access a database, supplying
parameters for unique database name, version number, display name, and
estimated size:

\code
var db = openDatabase('dbname', '1.0', 'my database', 1024);
\endcode

You interact with the database using asynchronous SQL transactions.
The following shows how you might create a table, insert data by
mapping in JavaScript variables, and traverse existing data:

\code
var x_id, x_value;
db.transaction(function (tx) {
    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tbl (id unique, text)');
    tx.executeSql('INSERT INTO tbl (id, text) VALUES (?, ?)', [x_id, x_value]);
    tx.executeSql('SELECT * FROM tbl', [], function(tx, results) {
        for (var i = 0 , l = results.rows.length; i < l; i++) {
            // do something with results.rows.item(i).text
        }
    });
});
\endcode

\section3 ooo Web SQL Databases

While common local- or session-based databases are capable of storing
complex data structures,
\if (0)
QtWebKit-based
\else
WebKit-based
\endif
browsers can also rely upon the Web SQL standard, which brings
SQLite-based structured database functionality, typically deployed on
servers, to client browser applications. Based on SQLite version
3.6.19, Web SQL is appropriate for data-intensive applications
requiring complex queries rather than simple key/value access.

The following test confirms support for Web SQL:

\code
if (!!window.openDatabase) {
    // supports Web SQL
}
\endcode

Calls to databases made via the Web SQL API are made asynchronously via
transactions to avoid the user interface from locking up, as database
interaction may occur from several windows at a time.

The three core API methods are:

\list

\li \c{openDatabase()}

\li \c{transaction()}

\li \c{executeSql()}

\endlist

\section3 ooo Creating and Opening a New Database

To create and open a database, use \c{openDatabase()}on the Window object,
for example:

\code
var db = openDatabase('mydb', '1.0', 'my first database', 2*1024*1024);
var db = openDatabase('notes', '', 'The Example Notes App!', 1048576);
\endcode

The four required arguments are the database name, version, display
name, and estimated size in bytes. You can supply a function as an
optional fifth argument to serve as a callback when a database is
created. It may be used to call the \c{changeversion()} method, in
which case the callback is invoked with an empty string for the
database version.

The second example above specifies an empty string for the version. In
this case the database opens no matter what the database version
is. (An \c{openDatabase()} call specifying the wrong version for an
existing database throws an \c{INVALID_STATE_ERR} exception.) You can
then query the version by examining the database object's version
property, for example:

\code
var version = db.version;
\endcode

Note that you don\'t need to close a client-side Web SQL database when
you\'re done working with it.

\section3 ooo Errors

Asynchronous API errors are reported using callbacks that have a
\c{SQLError} object as one of their arguments. \c{SQLError} contains a
code from the table below and a localized message string.

Error codes are:

\list

\li 0 \c{UNKNOWN_ERROR} Transaction failed for reasons unrelated to the DB

\li 1 \c{DATABASE_ERROR} Statement failed for DB reasons not covered by other
code

\li 2 \c{VERSION_ERROR} DB version doesn\'t match expected version

\li 3 \c{TOO_LARGE_ERROR} Data returned from DB was too large. Try the
\c{SQL LIMIT} modifier.

\li 4 \c{QUOTA_ERROR} Insufficient remaining storage

\li 5 \c{SYNTAX_ERROR} Syntax error, argument mismatch, or unallowed
statement

\li 6 \c{CONSTRAINT_ERROR} An \c{INSERT}, \c{UPDATE}, or \c{REPLACE}
statement failed due to a constraint error

\li 7 \c{TIMEOUT_ERROR} Timeout waiting for transaction lock

\endlist

\b{See Also:}

Doctor: Introducing Web SQL Databases}

\section3 ooo Transaction Calls and ExecuteSQL Method

Performing database transactions is superior to running SQL statements
directly because transactions are not committed if they fail and you
can undo them if needed. Transactions also allow you to handle errors
using a callback. To implement a transaction, specify a callback
function such as the following:

\code
db.transaction(function (tx) {
  // SQL details on the tx object go here
}
\endcode

The \c{transaction()} method takes one to three arguments:

\list

\li a required transaction callback, in which \c{executeSQL()} calls
belong

\li an optional transaction error object

\li an optional success callback.

\endlist

Use the \c{executeSQL()} method to specify SQL statements for read and
write operations. The method protects against SQL injection and
provides a callback method to process the results of any SQL queries
you specify. The \c{executeSQL()} method takes from one to four
arguments:

\list

\li a required SQL statement

\li an optional object array of arguments

\li an optional SQL statement callback

\li an optional SQL statement error callback

\endlist

The example below creates the database if it doesn\'t exist, adds a
two-column table to the database, and adds a row of data to the table:

\code
var db = openDatabase('mydb', '1.0', 'my first database', 2 * 1024 * 1024);
db.transaction(function (tx) {
    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS foo (id unique, text)');
    tx.executeSql('INSERT INTO foo (id, text) VALUES (1, "synergies")');
});
\endcode

To capture data from the user or an external source, use \c{?}
placeholders to map that data into the SQL query. This ensures the
data doesn\'t compromise database security, for example from SQL
injection:

\code
tx.executeSql('INSERT INTO foo (id, text) VALUES (?, ?)', [id, value]);
\endcode

\c{id} and \c{value} are external variables, and \c{executeSql} maps
the items in the array to the \c{?}s.

To select values from the table, use a callback to capture the
results:

\code
tx.executeSql('SELECT * FROM foo', [], function(tx, results) {
    for (var i = 0 , len = results.rows.length; i < len; i++) {
        // do something with results.rows.item(i).text
    }
});
\endcode

No fields are mapped in the above query, but to use the third argument
you need to pass in an empty array as the second argument.

The SQL statement callback for \c{executeSQL()} is called with the
\c{transaction} object and a SQL statement \c{result} object. The
\c{result} gives access to the ID of the last inserted row, the number
of rows affected, and an indexed list representing the rows returned,
in the order returned.

The \c{result} object contains an array-like \c{rows} object. It has a
length, but to access individual rows you need to use
\c{results.rows.item(i)}, where \c{i} is the index of the row. This
returns an object representation of each row. For example, if your
database has a \c{name} and an \c{age} field, the \c{row} contains a
\c{name} and an \c{age} property. The value of the \c{age} field can
be accessed using \c{results.rows.item(i).age}.

\section3 ooo Changing Database Versions

Each database has one version at a time and multiple versions cannot
exist at one time. Versions allow you to manage schema changes
incrementally.

You can change the version of a client-side Web SQL database using the
\c{changeversion()} method:

\code
if (db.version == "1.0") {
    try {
        // comment out for crash recovery.
        db.changeVersion("1.0", "2.0", cv_1_0_2_0, oops_1_0_2_0, success_1_0_2_0);
    } catch(e) {
        alert('changeversion 1.0 -> 2.0 failed');
        alert('DB Version: '+db.version);
    }
}
\endcode

\c{changeversion()} takes the following arguments: required old and
new version numbers, optional SQL transaction callback, optional SQL
transaction error callback, and optional success callback.

\list

\li Web SQL

\li (indexedDB)

\endlist

\section3 ooo Web Storage

Browser 8.5 supports HTML5's \c{localStorage} and \c{sessionStorage} APIs,
which offer a site up to 5MB of combined data storage on the client
browser. \e{Local} data is indefinitely persistent and available to
all pages per domain, while \e{session} data is confined for the
duration of a single window.

Databases are available via \c{window.localStorage} and
\c{window.sessionStorage} objects. You access these databases the same
way, via key/value pairs where both are represented as strings. The
\c{setItem()}, \c{getItem()}, and \c{removeItem()} methods affect
individual database keys, while \c{clear()} removes all data. The
\c{length()} and \c{key()} methods allow you to traverse databases
using array indexes:

\code
var db = window.localStorage;
var key, value;
for (var i = 0, l = db.length ; i < l ; i++) {
    key = db.key(i);
    value = db.getItem(key);
}
\endcode

Changes to a database can be examined via \c{storage} events that fire
on the \c{window} object. Call \c{event.oldValue} and
\c{event.newValue} to access the data. Call \c{key} for the name of
the modified field, \c{url} for the page modifying the field, or
\c{storageArea} for either database that is being modified.

\section3 ooo Simple Data Storage

The \c{localStorage} and \c{sessionStorage} APIs offer applications
up to 5MB of data storage. They both share the same simple key/value
interface, but have different namespaces and also differ in the extent
to which data is available. Local storage persists indefinitely, while
session storage only lasts for the duration of a window session. Local
storage is available from any page or window from the same site, while
session storage is local to each window.

The following set of examples demonstrate the API interface. While
these use \c{localStorage} as an example, the same set of API calls
work for \c{sessionStorage}, which is also available within the
\c{window} object.

The following performs an initial check for support of browser-based
storage and makes the database available within a variable:

\code
if (window.localStorage) {
    var db = window.localStorage;
    // storage functionality here
}
else {
    // store data remotely?
}
\endcode

The \c{getItem()} method retrieves the value of a database field named
\b{key}:

\code
var value = db.getItem("key");
\endcode

Both keys and values are represented as strings. If you specify any
other type of data, it is converted silently to a string. (See
\sub{Storing Non-String Data} for ways around this limitation.)  If
\c{getItem()} returns \c{null} rather than a string value, it means
the specified key does not exist.

The \c{setItem()} method establishes a new value. When adding data,
it is a good idea to check to make sure you haven\'t exceeded the
allotted storage space:

\code
try {
    db.setItem("key", "string");
}
catch(err) {
    if (err.QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR) {
        // not enough storage space
    }
}
\endcode

The \c{removeItem()} method deletes database fields:

\code
db.removeItem("key");
\endcode

The \c{clear()} method deletes all key/value pairs within the
database, either for an entire site in the case of \c{localStorage},
or for an individual window session in the case of \c{sessionStorage}:

\code
db.clear();
\endcode

Databases can be accessed as arrays using index notation, useful in
cases where you may not know all the field names. The \c{length}
property returns the number of fields in the database, and the
\c{key()} method returns the name of the key corresponding to a given
index. The following reflects the contents of a database in a
JavaScript object:

\code
var obj = {};
for ( var i = 0, l = db.length ; i < l ; i++ ) {
    obj[ db.key(i) ] = db.getItem( db.key(i) );
}
\endcode

Since keys correspond to array indexes, you should not add or remove
keys during any operation that iterates over the full set of key/value
pairs. Newly introduced keys are introduced randomly into the array\'s
sequence.

The following displays simple storage functionality. The application
prompts for a login and password if they are unavailable. This locally
stored data is available the next time users open the browser, by
pressing the icon in the top right of the main window. However, the
contents of the credit card field is stored only for the duration of
each browsing session.

\l{x_storage_data} {\inlineimage scr_storage_data.png
}

\l{x_storage_data_css} {\inlineimage icon_css.png
}
\l{x_storage_data_js} {\inlineimage icon_js.png
}

\section3 ooo Storage Events

The \c{storage} event allows applications to respond indirectly to
modified data resulting from calls to \c{setItem()}, \c{removeItem()},
or \c{clear()}. This may be useful in providing users with visual
feedback notifying them of data that is modified locally, perhaps
rather than being sent to a remote server:

\code
window.addEventListener("storage", function(event){
    var icon = document.querySelector("#indicator");
    if (event.storageArea.length) {
        icon.className = "writing";
    }
    else {
        icon.className = "empty";
    }
}, false);
\endcode

The \c{storage} event\'s \c{storageArea} attribute returns the
\c{localStorage} or \c{sessionStorage} object being modified. The
\c{key} is the name of the field being modified, and \c{oldValue} and
\c{newValue} are its values before and after the event. The \c{url} is
the page that called the method triggering the change.

\section3 ooo Storage Intro

Traditional mobile web development centered around the limitations of
client handsets, which had very little storage available for
applications. As handsets have become more powerful, however, this is
no longer the case. HTML5\'s newly introduced Storage, Application
Cache and Offline features push more functionality out to the client
browser and allow them to operate more autonomously as loosely
coupled, independently synchronizing applications.

The Application Cache allows the browser to download applications so
that they run entirely on the client browser. Navigating to a
cache-enabled page silently installs its component files onto the
browser. Users can then run the application locally on the client
browser, independently of the site that supplied it.

Self-contained applications such as games and calculators run
seamlessly in the absence of a network connection. Applications that
rely on network connections can respond to changes in network
availability with custom \b{offline} capabilities.

In addition to cached \e{applications}, standard \c{LocalStorage} and
\c{SessionStorage} APIs are available to dynamically cache application
\e{data}. These boost the amount of storage available to web
applications and can effectively replace cookies as a means to
track user preferences and maintain application state.

Both of these \e{web storage} mechanisms access data via simple
key/value pairs. As an alternative, Web SQL brings SQLite-based
structured database functionality, typically deployed on servers, to
client browser applications. Web SQL is appropriate for data-intensive
applications requiring complex queries rather than simple key/value
access.

\section3 ooo Storing Non-String Data

Since local and session storage APIs only support string values, you
need to be careful not to allow errors that result from passive
conversions from other data types. The following sample shows how
such an error might occur:

\code
var db = window.localStorage;
var saveCardInfo;
    // user expresses preference NOT to save credit card info:
saveCardInfo = false;
    // BUG happens here...
db.setItem("save_card_info", saveCardInfo);
    // variable is now a string, not a boolean:
saveCardInfo = db.getItem("save_card_info");
    // both "true" and "false" strings evaluate as true...
if ( saveCardInfo ) {
    // ...so this code always executes...
}
else {
    // ...and this code never executes.
}
\endcode

The user\'s preference to retain credit card information is expressed
within the application as a \c{true} or \c{false} boolean value. When
each value is passed to storage, however, it is passively converted to
a string. When reassigned to a JavaScript variable, it no longer
serves as a valid boolean test. The application falsely assumes users
want to save credit card information, regardless of their expressed
preference.

The following example fixes the problem. Instead of using \c{true} and
\c{false} boolean values, it converts \c{1} and \c{0} strings to
numbers:

\code
var db = window.localStorage;
var saveCardInfo = 0;
db.setItem("save_card_info", saveCardInfo);
// multiplying forces numeric output:
saveCardInfo = db.getItem("save_card_info") * 1;
\endcode

For a more reliable alternative, store values as JSON strings and rely
on automatic type conversion when subsequently parsing them. The
following sample shows how parsing JSON preserves both boolean and
numeric data:

\code
var saveCardInfo = true;      // boolean
var shipMethod = 2;           // number
var db = window.localStorage;

db.setItem("save_card_info" , JSON.stringify(saveCardInfo));
db.setItem("ship_method"    , JSON.stringify(shipMethod));

saveCardInfo = JSON.parse(db.getItem("save_card_info")); // boolean
shipMethod   = JSON.parse(db.getItem("ship_method"));    // number
\endcode

Note that this simple approach may cause problems of its own. For
example, perhaps the words \b{true} and \b{false} really should
be represented as strings. Encapsulating data within objects accounts
for such variability:

\code
var db = window.localStorage;
var obj = {
    bool : true,
    str  : "true",
    num  : 1
};
db.setItem("appState", JSON.stringify(obj)); // to database...
// "appState" is "{'bool':true,'num':1,'str':'true'}"
obj = JSON.parse(db.getItem("appState"));    // ...and back
// obj is same as initially defined.
\endcode

The ability to save objects as JSON strings means that you can save an
application\'s state within a single database field. For example, you
might use the following approach to save the entire contents of a
shopping cart in a single field for later use:

\code
var db = window.localStorage;
var cart = { items: [] };

cart.message = "From your loving uncle";

cart.items.push({
    description : "Floor to Ceiling Shoe Rack",
    id          : 203174676,
    price       : 99.95,
    quantity    : 1,
    weight      : 20,
});

cart.items.push({
    description : "Automatic Laser Toy for Cats",
    id          : 203345371,
    price       : 19.95,
    quantity    : 2,
    weight      : 0.5,
});

// save all cumulative items:
db.setItem("cart", JSON.stringify(cart));

// extract items from storage:
cart = JSON.parse(db.getItem("cart"));
\endcode

JSON allows you to store data types, but functions are ignored. That
makes it more difficult to preserve objects representing fully
functional applications.

\list

\li localStorage

\li sessionStorage

\li an optional transaction error object

\li an optional success callback.

\endlist

Use the \c{executeSQL()} method to specify SQL statements for read and
write operations. The method protects against SQL injection and
provides a callback method to process the results of any SQL queries
you specify. The \c{executeSQL()} method takes from one to four
arguments:

\list

\li a required SQL statement

\li an optional object array of arguments

\li an optional SQL statement callback

\li an optional SQL statement error callback

\endlist

The example below creates the database if it doesn\'t exist, adds a
two-column table to the database, and adds a row of data to the table:

\code
var db = openDatabase('mydb', '1.0', 'my first database', 2 * 1024 * 1024);
db.transaction(function (tx) {
    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS foo (id unique, text)');
    tx.executeSql('INSERT INTO foo (id, text) VALUES (1, "synergies")');
});
\endcode

To capture data from the user or an external source, use \c{?}
placeholders to map that data into the SQL query. This ensures the
data doesn\'t compromise database security, for example from SQL
injection:

\code
tx.executeSql('INSERT INTO foo (id, text) VALUES (?, ?)', [id, value]);
\endcode

\c{id} and \c{value} are external variables, and \c{executeSql} maps
the items in the array to the \c{?}s.

To select values from the table, use a callback to capture the
results:

\code
tx.executeSql('SELECT * FROM foo', [], function(tx, results) {
    for (var i = 0 , len = results.rows.length; i < len; i++) {
        // do something with results.rows.item(i).text
    }
});
\endcode

No fields are mapped in the above query, but to use the third argument
you need to pass in an empty array as the second argument.

The SQL statement callback for \c{executeSQL()} is called with the
\c{transaction} object and a SQL statement \c{result} object. The
\c{result} gives access to the ID of the last inserted row, the number
of rows affected, and an indexed list representing the rows returned,
in the order returned.

The \c{result} object contains an array-like \c{rows} object. It has a
length, but to access individual rows you need to use
\c{results.rows.item(i)}, where \c{i} is the index of the row. This
returns an object representation of each row. For example, if your
database has a \c{name} and an \c{age} field, the \c{row} contains a
\c{name} and an \c{age} property. The value of the \c{age} field can
be accessed using \c{results.rows.item(i).age}.

\section3 ooo Changing Database Versions

Each database has one version at a time and multiple versions cannot
exist at one time. Versions allow you to manage schema changes
incrementally.

You can change the version of a client-side Web SQL database using the
\c{changeversion()} method:

\code
if (db.version == "1.0") {
    try {
        // comment out for crash recovery.
        db.changeVersion("1.0", "2.0", cv_1_0_2_0, oops_1_0_2_0, success_1_0_2_0);
    } catch(e) {
        alert('changeversion 1.0 -> 2.0 failed');
        alert('DB Version: '+db.version);
    }
}
\endcode

\c{changeversion()} takes the following arguments: required old and
new version numbers, optional SQL transaction callback, optional SQL
transaction error callback, and optional success callback.

\list

\li Web SQL

\li (indexedDB)

\section3 ooo Web Storage

Browser 8.5 supports HTML5's \c{localStorage} and \c{sessionStorage} APIs,
which offer a site up to 5MB of combined data storage on the client
browser. \e{Local} data is indefinitely persistent and available to
all pages per domain, while \e{session} data is confined for the
duration of a single window.

Databases are available via \c{window.localStorage} and
\c{window.sessionStorage} objects. You access these databases the same
way, via key/value pairs where both are represented as strings. The
\c{setItem()}, \c{getItem()}, and \c{removeItem()} methods affect
individual database keys, while \c{clear()} removes all data. The
\c{length()} and \c{key()} methods allow you to traverse databases
using array indexes:

\code
var db = window.localStorage;
var key, value;
for (var i = 0, l = db.length ; i < l ; i++) {
    key = db.key(i);
    value = db.getItem(key);
}
\endcode

Changes to a database can be examined via \c{storage} events that fire
on the \c{window} object. Call \c{event.oldValue} and
\c{event.newValue} to access the data. Call \c{key} for the name of
the modified field, \c{url} for the page modifying the field, or
\c{storageArea} for either database that is being modified.

\section3 ooo Simple Data Storage

The \c{localStorage} and \c{sessionStorage} APIs offer applications
up to 5MB of data storage. They both share the same simple key/value
interface, but have different namespaces and also differ in the extent
to which data is available. Local storage persists indefinitely, while
session storage only lasts for the duration of a window session. Local
storage is available from any page or window from the same site, while
session storage is local to each window.

The following set of examples demonstrate the API interface. While
these use \c{localStorage} as an example, the same set of API calls
work for \c{sessionStorage}, which is also available within the
\c{window} object.

The following performs an initial check for support of browser-based
storage and makes the database available within a variable:

\code
if (window.localStorage) {
    var db = window.localStorage;
    // storage functionality here
}
else {
    // store data remotely?
}
\endcode

The \c{getItem()} method retrieves the value of a database field named
\b{key}:

\code
var value = db.getItem("key");
\endcode

Both keys and values are represented as strings. If you specify any
other type of data, it is converted silently to a string. (See
\sub{Storing Non-String Data} for ways around this limitation.)  If
\c{getItem()} returns \c{null} rather than a string value, it means
the specified key does not exist.

The \c{setItem()} method establishes a new value. When adding data,
it is a good idea to check to make sure you haven\'t exceeded the
allotted storage space:

\code
try {
    db.setItem("key", "string");
}
catch(err) {
    if (err.QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR) {
        // not enough storage space
    }
}
\endcode

The \c{removeItem()} method deletes database fields:

\code
db.removeItem("key");
\endcode

The \c{clear()} method deletes all key/value pairs within the
database, either for an entire site in the case of \c{localStorage},
or for an individual window session in the case of \c{sessionStorage}:

\code
db.clear();
\endcode

Databases can be accessed as arrays using index notation, useful in
cases where you may not know all the field names. The \c{length}
property returns the number of fields in the database, and the
\c{key()} method returns the name of the key corresponding to a given
index. The following reflects the contents of a database in a
JavaScript object:

\code
var obj = {};
for ( var i = 0, l = db.length ; i < l ; i++ ) {
    obj[ db.key(i) ] = db.getItem( db.key(i) );
}
\endcode

Since keys correspond to array indexes, you should not add or remove
keys during any operation that iterates over the full set of key/value
pairs. Newly introduced keys are introduced randomly into the array\'s
sequence.

The following displays simple storage functionality. The application
prompts for a login and password if they are unavailable. This locally
stored data is available the next time users open the browser, by
pressing the icon in the top right of the main window. However, the
contents of the credit card field is stored only for the duration of
each browsing session.

}

\l{x_storage_data_css} {\inlineimage icon_css.png
}
\l{x_storage_data_js} {\inlineimage icon_js.png
}

\section3 ooo Storage Events

The \c{storage} event allows applications to respond indirectly to
modified data resulting from calls to \c{setItem()}, \c{removeItem()},
or \c{clear()}. This may be useful in providing users with visual
feedback notifying them of data that is modified locally, perhaps
rather than being sent to a remote server:

\code
window.addEventListener("storage", function(event){
    var icon = document.querySelector("#indicator");
    if (event.storageArea.length) {
        icon.className = "writing";
    }
    else {
        icon.className = "empty";
    }
}, false);
\endcode

The \c{storage} event\'s \c{storageArea} attribute returns the
\c{localStorage} or \c{sessionStorage} object being modified. The
\c{key} is the name of the field being modified, and \c{oldValue} and
\c{newValue} are its values before and after the event. The \c{url} is
the page that called the method triggering the change.

\section3 ooo Storage Intro

Traditional mobile web development centered around the limitations of
client handsets, which had very little storage available for
applications. As handsets have become more powerful, however, this is
no longer the case. HTML5\'s newly introduced Storage, Application
Cache and Offline features push more functionality out to the client
browser and allow them to operate more autonomously as loosely
coupled, independently synchronizing applications.

The Application Cache allows the browser to download applications so
that they run entirely on the client browser. Navigating to a
cache-enabled page silently installs its component files onto the
browser. Users can then run the application locally on the client
browser, independently of the site that supplied it.

Self-contained applications such as games and calculators run
seamlessly in the absence of a network connection. Applications that
rely on network connections can respond to changes in network
availability with custom \b{offline} capabilities.

In addition to cached \e{applications}, standard \c{LocalStorage} and
\c{SessionStorage} APIs are available to dynamically cache application
\e{data}. These boost the amount of storage available to web
applications and can effectively replace cookies as a means to
track user preferences and maintain application state.

Both of these \e{web storage} mechanisms access data via simple
key/value pairs. As an alternative, Web SQL brings SQLite-based
structured database functionality, typically deployed on servers, to
client browser applications. Web SQL is appropriate for data-intensive
applications requiring complex queries rather than simple key/value
access.

\section3 ooo Storing Non-String Data

Since local and session storage APIs only support string values, you
need to be careful not to allow errors that result from passive
conversions from other data types. The following sample shows how
such an error might occur:

\code
var db = window.localStorage;
var saveCardInfo;
    // user expresses preference NOT to save credit card info:
saveCardInfo = false;
    // BUG happens here...
db.setItem("save_card_info", saveCardInfo);
    // variable is now a string, not a boolean:
saveCardInfo = db.getItem("save_card_info");
    // both "true" and "false" strings evaluate as true...
if ( saveCardInfo ) {
    // ...so this code always executes...
}
else {
    // ...and this code never executes.
}
\endcode

The user\'s preference to retain credit card information is expressed
within the application as a \c{true} or \c{false} boolean value. When
each value is passed to storage, however, it is passively converted to
a string. When reassigned to a JavaScript variable, it no longer
serves as a valid boolean test. The application falsely assumes users
want to save credit card information, regardless of their expressed
preference.

The following example fixes the problem. Instead of using \c{true} and
\c{false} boolean values, it converts \c{1} and \c{0} strings to
numbers:

\code
var db = window.localStorage;
var saveCardInfo = 0;
db.setItem("save_card_info", saveCardInfo);
// multiplying forces numeric output:
saveCardInfo = db.getItem("save_card_info") * 1;
\endcode

For a more reliable alternative, store values as JSON strings and rely
on automatic type conversion when subsequently parsing them. The
following sample shows how parsing JSON preserves both boolean and
numeric data:

\code
var saveCardInfo = true;      // boolean
var shipMethod = 2;           // number
var db = window.localStorage;

db.setItem("save_card_info" , JSON.stringify(saveCardInfo));
db.setItem("ship_method"    , JSON.stringify(shipMethod));

saveCardInfo = JSON.parse(db.getItem("save_card_info")); // boolean
shipMethod   = JSON.parse(db.getItem("ship_method"));    // number
\endcode

Note that this simple approach may cause problems of its own. For
example, perhaps the words \b{true} and \b{false} really should
be represented as strings. Encapsulating data within objects accounts
for such variability:

\code
var db = window.localStorage;
var obj = {
    bool : true,
    str  : "true",
    num  : 1
};
db.setItem("appState", JSON.stringify(obj)); // to database...
// "appState" is "{'bool':true,'num':1,'str':'true'}"
obj = JSON.parse(db.getItem("appState"));    // ...and back
// obj is same as initially defined.
\endcode

The ability to save objects as JSON strings means that you can save an
application\'s state within a single database field. For example, you
might use the following approach to save the entire contents of a
shopping cart in a single field for later use:

\code
var db = window.localStorage;
var cart = { items: [] };

cart.message = "From your loving uncle";

cart.items.push({
    description : "Floor to Ceiling Shoe Rack",
    id          : 203174676,
    price       : 99.95,
    quantity    : 1,
    weight      : 20,
});

cart.items.push({
    description : "Automatic Laser Toy for Cats",
    id          : 203345371,
    price       : 19.95,
    quantity    : 2,
    weight      : 0.5,
});

// save all cumulative items:
db.setItem("cart", JSON.stringify(cart));

// extract items from storage:
cart = JSON.parse(db.getItem("cart"));
\endcode

JSON allows you to store data types, but functions are ignored. That
makes it more difficult to preserve objects representing fully
functional applications.
