# Location and Travel

HTML5's Geolocation API enables web applications a simple, consistent
cross-device interface to gather information about users' location,
based on GPS or network signals. This section shows how to extract
location and present it within a simple map interface.

###  The Geolocation API

Location data is available via a single API call.  The
`getCurrentPosition` method runs an asynchronous callback function
once location is detected:

```
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(getCoordinates);

function getCoordinates(position) {
    var lat  = position.coords.latitude;
    var lon  = position.coords.longitude;
    var time = position.timestamp; // equivalent to Date object
    // process coordinates
}
```

Before the callback executes, the browser asks users permission to use
their location data, for each session and domain.

> __NOTE__: The Geolocation API exposes the location of mobile users, information
that potentially compromises their privacy.  Unless an application
ckearly offers location-_sharing_ features, users who opt in should
be able to expect their personal data to be treated with the same
confidence and sensitivity as passwords and credit card data.

Most applications simply extract `latitude` and `longitude` from
`coords`, both values expressed as \Eplumin 90\Edeg or \Eplumin
180\Edeg.  The `coords` object also features an `accuracy`
property indicating the number of meters considered a margin of error.
Additional properties may be available for `altitude` and
`altitudeAccuracy`, also expressed in meters, but these do not have
a wide application and would only be available on some GPS-enabled
handsets.

###  Fallback Behavior

The `getCurrentPosition()` method accepts an optional second
argument specifying an error fallback. The following example accounts
for various problems that might keep the application from working. An
object detection test responds if for older browsers that do not
support location:

```
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(successCallback, errorFallback);
}
else {
    // Browser does not support HTML5-based location.
}
```

An additional error callback responds differently when users decide
not to share their location. Depending on the importance of location
to the application, it may then be appropriate to prompt users if they
want to \l{Data Storage} {store that decision as a preference}:

```
function errorFallback(err) {
    if (err.PERMISSION_DENIED) {
        // User does not consent to sharing location.
    }
    else {
        // indicates a problem beyond the user's direct control
    }
}
function successCallback(position) {
    var lat = position.coords.latitude;
    var lon = position.coords.longitude;
    // process coordinates
}
```

The following errors may occur:

- __1__ `PERMISSION_DENIED` indicates the user rejects the
location request.

- __2__ `POSITION_UNAVAILABLE` means the location mechanism is
unavailable. Perhaps no GPS satellite could be found, or not enough
network signals are available to perform triangulation.

- __3__ `TIMEOUT` means the location service may be available,
but the request took too long.

- __0__ `UNKNOWN_ERROR` refers to anything else that might
happen.

The timeout interval is configurable. The `getCurrentPosition`
method accepts a third argument, consisting of additional options
stored in an object. The following makes the location request wait
at least five seconds before timing out:

```
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(successCallback,
                       errorFallback, { timeout: 5000 });
```

The following parameters are available:

- `timeout` is the minimum number of milliseconds before which a
location request throws a `TIMEOUT` error.

- `maximumAge` is the maximum number of milliseconds for which
location requests might rely upon on a previously cached value. It may
even be set to `Infinity`.

- `enableHighAccuracy` is a boolean that prompts the positioning
system to produce more accurate values than the default. This option
would likely be limited to applications targeted to pedestrians using
a narrow range of GPS-enabled handsets.

###  Tracking Location

Once an application has calculated the user's location, it might
respond by providing contextual information, such as location-specific
search results or suggestions for nearby points of interest. It may
respond even better if it tracks the user's location over time. For
example, suggestions for points of interest may be more relevant if
they're in the user's general direction of travel. Some suggestions
may likewise be more appropriate for pedestrians than for people
traveling in vehicles.

To gather this information, use the `watchPosition()` method. It
resembles `getCurrentPosition()`, but executes indefinitely as
position changes are detected. It uses the same interface, but returns
a numeric key when invoked:

```
var process = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(successCallback,
                errorFallback, { maximumAge: 10000, timeout: 60000 });
```

Much like JavaScript's standard `clearInterval()` function, you
supply this key to the `clearWatch()` method when you need to
terminate the process and stop tracking the user's location:

```
navigator.geolocation.clearWatch(process);
```

This example specifies two additional options. The `timeout` option
sets the threshold before which a network delay causes the fallback
function to execute. In this case, it is extended to a full minute.
After the application initially determines location, users may briefly
wander out of range of network signals, in which case the application
shouldn't terminate abruptly.

The `maximumAge` option effectively reduces the data's level of
detail, in this case producing new location values only every 10
seconds. Frequent location requests taxes the battery. This option
allows the application to reduce the number of requests to suit its
needs.

Note that the callback specified by `watchPosition` still executes
even if its position values are cached. The following example
maintains a local `path` array of tracked locations, but filters out
redundant instances of the same location:

```
var app = new Function();
app.path = new Array();

var id = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(
              successCallback, errorFallback,
              { maximumAge: 10000, timeout: 60000 }
         );

function successCallback(position) {
    var latitude = position.coords.latitude;
    var longitude = position.coords.longitude;
    var len = app.path.length;

    // ignore redundant cached values:
    if ( len && ( latitude  == app.path[len-1].lat )
             && ( longitude == app.path[len-1].lon ) ) return false;

    // otherwise add new values:
    app.path.push({"lat" : latitude, "lon" : longitude});
}
```

The example \l{Tracking Location} maintains a local cache of
the user's whereabouts, which can be used to calculate overall speed
and direction of travel. The API also yields this data, but only based
on a comparison between the current location and the most recently
cached location:

- The `position.coords.speed` property is expressed in meters per
second.

- The `position.coords.heading` property represents the current
direction of movement in degrees, measured clockwise relative to
due north.

###  Mapping

Once the user's position is known, information is usually presented
within a map.  Many web-based mapping APIs are available to choose
from, many of which feature touch-enabled panning and zooming. This
section briefly outlines the basic capabilities of the
[Ovi Maps API](http://api.maps.ovi.com).

To enable maps, on a page add the following `script` before any
others on the page:

```
<script src="http://api.maps.ovi.com/jsl.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

Displaying the map requires you to place an empty element on the page,
preferably styling it so that it fills the screen:

```
<section id="map"></section>
```

The following draws a map within the element, centered around the
supplied coordinates:

```
function renderMap(lat, lon) {
    var map = new ovi.mapsapi.map.Display(document.getElementById('map'), {
        'center': [lat, lon], // center coordinates
        'zoomLevel': 15,      // default level suitable for pedestrians
    });
}
```

By default, maps renders statically, but you can add components to
make them interactive:

```
function renderMap(lat, lon) {
    var map = new ovi.mapsapi.map.Display(document.getElementById('map'), {
        'center': [lat, lon],
        'zoomLevel': 15,
         components : [
                new ovi.mapsapi.map.component.Behavior(),
                // new ovi.mapsapi.map.component.TypeSelector(),
                // new ovi.mapsapi.map.component.ZoomBar(),
                // new ovi.mapsapi.map.component.Overview(),
                // new ovi.mapsapi.map.component.ScaleBar()
              ],
    });
}
```

When targeting mobile users, you should be selective in which of these
components to deploy. For example, the `Behavior` component allows
users to drag the map to explore places not visible within the initial
area displayed. If you display the map along with other information
within a much larger page, users may become confused when panning
within the map produces different results than panning vertically
within the page.

The other disabled components produce small overlays that crowd the
mobile screen and are often difficult to manipulate on mobile
browsers.  The `TypeSelector` provides controls switching from the
default street map to less legible satellite or terrain maps.  The
`ScaleBar` displays a legend noting the range of distances.  The
`Overview` produces a small map inset displaying surrounding areas.
The `ZoomBar` presents a slider to control zoom level.

The following specifies a marker and places it on the screen:

```
var marker = new ovi.mapsapi.map.StandardMarker([lat, lon]);
map.objects.add(app.marker);
```

The following customizes the marker icon:

```
var marker = new ovi.mapsapi.map.Marker( [lat, lon],
                    { icon: "img/icon_geo_pin.gif" } );
```

The following example shows a simple mapping interface that marks the
user's location:

\l{x_loc_simple} {\inlineimage scr_loc_simple.png
}

\l{x_loc_simple_css} {\inlineimage icon_css.png
}\l{x_loc_simple_js} {\inlineimage icon_js.png
}

When the handset is placed on its side, the map fills the entire
screen.  In \l{Orientation via CSS} {portrait orientation}, large
touch icons appear that implement the zoom feature independently of
controls supplied by the API, or its support for multi-point touch
gestures.  To accomplish this, the controls call the `setZoomLevel`
method directly on the map element:

```
map.setZoomLevel(15);
```

See the [Ovi Maps Web API](http://api.maps.ovi.com/playground2/)
page for information on performing searches, plotting routes, and
placing custom overlays.

##  XXX 8.5 Loc?

The user's location is available via the Geolocation API. Geographic
coordinates are available via asynchronous callback function:

```
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(successCallback, errorFallback);

function successCallback(position) {
    var lat  = position.coords.latitude;
    var lon  = position.coords.longitude;
    var time = position.timestamp; // same as Date object
    // process lat/lon coordinates
}
```

For each session and domain, users are asked if they want to share
their location. If the user declines, it is available as a
`PERMISSION_DENIED` error within the second callback function.
(Other potential errors beyond the user's control are
`POSITION_UNAVAILABLE` (positioning mechanism unavailable),
`TIMEOUT`, and `UNKNOWN_ERROR`.)

```
function errorFallback(err) {
    if (err.PERMISSION_DENIED) {
        // User does not consent to sharing location.
    }
    else {
        // indicates a problem beyond the user's direct control
    }
}
```

The `timeout`, 5 seconds in this case, can be passed in as an
additional object's parameter:

```
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition( successCallback,
    errorFallback, { timeout: 5000 } );
```

The `getCurrentPosition` method calculates location only once. If
it's important to track the user's progress over time, the
`watchPosition()` method uses the same interface. Passing the
process it returns to `clearWatch()` cancels location-tracking.

```
// start watching user's location:
var process = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(successCallback,
                errorFallback, { timeout: 60000, maximumAge: 10000 });
// stop:
navigator.geolocation.clearWatch(process);
```

The `maximumAge` delays each sampled location, in this case once
every 10 seconds. Increasing the `timeout` allows the user to
briefly go out of range without causing an error.

##  Example: Mapping

This simple example uses the [Ovi Maps API](http://api.maps.ovi.com/) to mark the user's location on a map:

\l{x_location_htm} {
  \inlineimage location1.png
  \inlineimage location2.png
}

\l{x_location_htm} {
    __IFRAME__
}
\l{x_location_htm} {
    \inlineimage icon_html.png
}
\l{x_location_css} {
    \inlineimage icon_css.png
}
\l{x_location_js} {
    \inlineimage icon_js.png
}

To enable mapping, add this before any other scripts:

```
<script src="http://api.maps.ovi.com/jsl.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

Once _lat_ and _lon_ coordinates are available, you can fill in a
large screen element:

```
var map = new ovi.mapsapi.map.Display(document.getElementById('map'), {
    'center': [lat, lon],
    'zoomLevel': 15,
     components : [ new ovi.mapsapi.map.component.Behavior(), ],
});
```

This adds a marker to the map:

```
var marker = new ovi.mapsapi.map.StandardMarker([lat, lon]);
map.objects.add(marker);
```
