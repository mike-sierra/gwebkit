<p>A long time ago <br/> in a galaxy far away, you would not have been
able to render this famous cinematic title effect within a mobile
browser.
</p>

<p>But now we are entering into a period of new&nbsp;hope, and all it
takes is some CSS.
</p>

<p>(You don't even need to use any JavaScript.)
</p>

<p>This page demonstrates several CSS features: Marquees, 3D
Transforms, and Text Shadows.
</p>

<p>Setting "overflow" to "-webkit-marquee" makes the text scroll.
Setting the marquee's "direction" to "up" causes text to scroll
upwards. With its "repetition" set to 1, it only executes once. You
can also set the "speed" (frame rate in millseconds) and "increment"
(number of pixels each frame jumps).
</p>

<p>The text within this marquee remains active, so you can
<br/> <a href="_css3_marquee.htm">select links</a> <br/> as they
scroll by.
</p>

<p>The element is also rotated in 3D space along the X axis.  Adding
perspective makes the text appear to recede.
</p>

<p>Several shadows are applied to the text: some to outline it
slightly to improve legibility against varying backgrounds, and
another to make it appear dramatically raised above a surface.
</p>

<p>Using shadows in this way to outline text leads to a smoother
animation than if you were to apply a text stroke.
</p>

<p>Have fun with it.</p>
