Rot a peck of pa's malt had Jhem or Shen brewed by arclight and rory
end to the regginbrow was to be seen ringsome on the aquaface.
The fall
(bababadalgharaghtakamminarronnkonnbronntonnerronntuonnthunntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoohoordenenthurnuk!)
of a once wallstrait oldparr is retaled early in bed and later on life
down through all christian minstrelsy. The great fall of the offwall
entailed at such short notice the pftjschute of Finnegan, erse solid
man, that the humptyhillhead of humself prumptly sends an unquiring
one well to the west in quest of his tumptytumtoes: and their
upturnpikepointandplace is at the knock out in the park where oranges
have been laid to rust upon the green since devlinsfirst loved livvy.
