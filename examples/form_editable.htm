<h3>ContentEditable</h3>

<p>Mobile web developers should use the following guidelines when
implementing editable text:

<ul>

<li id="i1">visually distinguish editable from static text

<li id="i2">allow touch navigation around long blocks of active text

<li id="i3">apply an optional editing mode

<li id="i4">decide whether to support inline text formatting

<li id="i5">decide whether to allow users to create new elements

</ul>

<div id="clear" onclick="revert()">Clear All Edits</div>

</article>
</section>
<script src="js/form_editable.js"></script>
<script>

    var warning = 'Are you sure you want to clear all edits to this page?';
    if (! confirm(warning)) return(false);
    window.localStorage.clear();
    window.location.reload()
}
